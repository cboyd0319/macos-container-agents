# RunHaven TUI Vendor Baseline

This directory maps the upstream Codex TUI source path:

```text
https://github.com/openai/codex.git
commit: 5267e805fb830891c0b23376bcd9cbd382c3473c
path: codex-rs/tui/src/
```

to the local RunHaven vendored path:

```text
crates/runhaven-tui/src/tui/
```

It also includes Codex terminal detection copied from the same upstream commit:

```text
codex-rs/terminal-detection/src/
```

The upstream source is the OpenAI Codex TUI and is licensed under Apache-2.0.
RunHaven keeps attribution in `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` and
`licenses/codex-Apache-2.0.txt`.

This is a baseline copy before RunHaven product integration. It intentionally
keeps Codex TUI structure first, then RunHaven will adapt the parts it needs.
The active Strategy C integration plan lives in
`docs/plans/codex-tui-strategy-c/`.

Run the vendor audit with:

```bash
scripts/compare-codex-tui.sh
```

That command fetches the pinned upstream Codex source from GitHub into a
temporary checkout and compares all files under `codex-rs/tui/src/`, including
Rust source, helper binaries, nested tests, and upstream snapshot files.

Local exclusions in this baseline:

- `.DS_Store` files, because they are local filesystem metadata.
- upstream `*.snap` files, because they are Codex test goldens. They stay
  external in the pinned upstream Codex source by default, while RunHaven
  snapshots cover wired RunHaven behavior.

Current vendor audit summary:

- Upstream files under `codex-rs/tui/src/`: 894.
- RunHaven files under `crates/runhaven-tui/src/tui/`: 369.
- Common file paths: 356.
- Upstream files not vendored: 538, all `.snap` files.
- RunHaven-only files: 13.
- Copied Codex files with local edits: 26.

```

Local source-format exception:

- `markdown_render_tests.rs` uses `concat!` for one Markdown hard-break fixture
  so the runtime test input still contains two trailing spaces, while the source
  file satisfies RunHaven's whitespace check.

Local integration exceptions:

- `mod.rs` is the temporary RunHaven module entrypoint during integration. It
  keeps the crate buildable and fails closed for interactive TUI launch until
  the vendored Codex entrypoint is adapted.
- `terminal_detection.rs` and `terminal_tests.rs` are copied from the Codex
  terminal-detection crate because the native pet image protocol depends on the
  same iTerm2, Kitty, Sixel, tmux, and Zellij decisions as Codex.
- `pets/picker.rs` and `pets/preview.rs` remain vendored but are not compiled
  against the full Codex bottom-pane view yet. They compile against the staged
  `bottom_pane` selection contract in `mod.rs` until the full bottom-pane view
  is adapted.
- `pets/model.rs` formats the SHA-256 cache key bytes explicitly because
  RunHaven is pinned to `sha2` 0.11. The produced cache key string stays the
  same shape as Codex.
- `app_event`, `app_event_sender`, and `bottom_pane` in `mod.rs` are staged
  contracts for compiled vendored surfaces. Replace them with full Codex
  adapters as those surfaces come online.
- `render/renderable.rs` is now compiled through the RunHaven adapter with one
  Ratatui 0.30 compatibility tweak: `Line` renders through the borrowed
  `WidgetRef` implementation.
- `terminal_title.rs` is compiled as a vendored app-shell helper. It keeps
  Codex's OSC title sanitization rules intact.
- `motion.rs`, `shimmer.rs`, `color.rs`, `terminal_palette.rs`, and
  `terminal_probe.rs` are compiled as the Codex motion and terminal-theme
  foundation. Their module paths point through `crate::tui`.
- `motion.rs` keeps the Codex animation-primitive boundary test, pointed at
  `crates/runhaven-tui/src/tui/` and using RunHaven's existing `regex` dependency
  instead of Codex's crate-root test helper.
- `terminal_palette.rs` uses the vendored bounded terminal probe for Unix
  default-color requery because RunHaven has not adopted Codex's pinned
  crossterm fork with color-query helpers.
- `style.rs`, `line_truncation.rs`, `text_formatting.rs`, `wrapping.rs`, and
  `render/line_utils.rs` are compiled as shared Codex UI helpers. Their module
  paths point through `crate::tui`.
- `serde_json` enables `preserve_order` at the RunHaven crate level to match
  Codex TUI's compact JSON formatting behavior.
- `app_shell.rs` is temporary RunHaven-owned shell glue. It restores bare
  interactive `runhaven` to a read-only launch preview while the full Codex app
  shell is still being adapted. It now hosts a Codex `ListSelectionView`
  launch picker through `runhaven/launch_wizard.rs`.
- `runhaven/service.rs` is the temporary RunHaven TUI service seam. It turns
  `runhaven-core` profiles and planner output into launch preview payloads, so
  `app_shell.rs` does not call core planner APIs directly and
  `launch_wizard.rs` stays UI-owned.
- `runhaven/protocol.rs` and `runhaven/app_server_client.rs` are the local
  Strategy C backend facade. They mirror Codex's app-server client shape while
  keeping RunHaven runtime authority in `runhaven-core` and fail-closing
  unsupported Codex method families.
- `runhaven/app_server_session.rs` is the local Strategy C session bridge for
  this phase. It routes supported bootstrap, agent-catalog, and workspace
  validation calls into the RunHaven facade and returns typed unsupported errors
  for method families that are not promoted into the RunHaven security model.
- `runhaven/terminal_handoff.rs` is the local Phase 4 smoke hook. It proves
  Codex `Tui::with_restored` can release terminal ownership for a harmless
  foreground child and restore afterward without wiring real agent launch.
- `tui.rs` now compiles as `codex_runtime` under the temporary RunHaven module
  entrypoint. The local edits adapt nested module paths, the Ratatui backend
  error bound, deterministic terminal-handoff tests, and combined ambient plus
  picker-preview pet image cleanup for RunHaven's pinned dependency set.
- `tui/event_stream.rs` uses local `super::job_control` paths because
  `tui.rs` is nested as `codex_runtime` during integration, and keeps a
  deterministic pause/drop/resume regression for foreground handoff.
- `app.rs` uses the combined pet-image cleanup helper during native app
  shutdown so ambient and picker-preview image state are both cleared.
- `custom_terminal.rs`, `insert_history.rs`, `terminal_hyperlinks.rs`, and
  `test_backend.rs` keep Codex runtime behavior with Ratatui 0.30 compatibility
  edits for color conversion, backend error bounds, scrolling-region test
  support, and deprecated `Cell::skip` usage that remains part of the pinned
  upstream source shape.
- Two upstream `insert_history.rs` snapshot tests are opt-in behind
  `codex-vendored-tests` so default RunHaven tests do not create untracked
  `.snap.new` files from external Codex goldens.

Known integration gap:

- The copied Codex crate source still uses Codex crate/module assumptions.
  RunHaven integration will adapt entrypoints, module paths, dependencies, and
  product data in later commits.
- The dormant Codex `Tui` runtime spine now compiles and has focused tests, but
  it is not the active bare-interactive app loop yet.
- The launch picker, read-only review, and confirmation screen are staged in
  `app_shell.rs` plus `runhaven/service.rs`, not the real Codex `App` loop.
  Workspace selection, policy changes, and final foreground launch still need
  to be reattached through the Codex-shaped runtime.
- `tui/mod.rs` has a test guard for dormant host-reaching Codex surfaces. If
  `app`, `app_server_session`, onboarding auth, local ChatGPT auth, external
  editor, clipboard copy, or hooks RPC modules are activated, the test requires
  their risky upstream markers to be removed or fail-closed first.
- Foreground launch must be prepared by the RunHaven service but executed by the
  UI loop only after Codex terminal restore. Backend service tasks must not own
  raw terminal state.
