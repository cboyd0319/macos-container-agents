RunHaven is a Rust CLI with an unreleased terminal UI and an alpha
Tauri/Svelte desktop shell for running Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, Antigravity,
Copilot, or custom coding agents inside Apple `container` on macOS 26+ (Apple
silicon only). It does not replace those tools. It gives them a repeatable local
boundary so the secure way to run an agent is also the easy way.

It is built for people who sign in to their coding agent with a subscription or
OAuth account (Claude Pro/Max, ChatGPT, a Google account, GitHub), not only with
API keys. Signing in is one command and is reused across runs, and your host
login is never read or mounted.

## Current Surfaces

| Surface | Status | Use it for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CLI | `v0.5.0` pre-release, complete for the current command contract | Automation, explicit commands, recovery, diagnostics, and the stable backend for every UI. |
| Terminal UI | Active Codex-vendored TUI, unreleased | A bare interactive `runhaven` opens the RunHaven TUI for workspace choice, agent choice, network/auth policy changes, plan review, typed launch confirmation, foreground launch handoff, active-run summaries, confirmation-gated log snapshots, run history, diagnostics, and post-run recovery. |
| Desktop app | Alpha scaffold | Typed setup, launch, status, bounded logs, run control, and diagnostics. More maintenance and worktree flows remain CLI-first. |

## Why RunHaven

AI coding agents can inspect a project, edit files, run commands, and iterate
fast. That same power is risky when the agent runs directly on your Mac with
ambient access to your home directory, shell environment, SSH keys, cloud
credentials, browser profiles, and unrelated repositories. RunHaven puts each
run inside a bounded sandbox.

| Risk or need | RunHaven answer |
| --- | --- |
| Broad host access | Mounts one selected workspace at `/workspace`, not your whole home directory or credential folders. |
| Ambient credentials | Does not mount raw SSH keys, browser profiles, cloud credential folders, provider login caches, or arbitrary environment variables by default. |
| Unclear execution | `runhaven plan` prints the workspace, state volume, network mode, egress status, preflight, and Apple `container run` command before execution. |
| Repeated sign-in | `runhaven login <agent>` signs in once and reuses isolated agent state across runs. Claude uses an explicit host setup-token flow; RunHaven never reads your `~/.claude.json`, macOS Keychain, or browser profiles. |
| Network sprawl | Uses a secure profile-aware default: provider allowlist where the agent's hosts are bundled, otherwise internet. Local-only `internal` and explicit `--network` overrides remain available. |
| Risky edits | `--worktree` runs in a RunHaven-owned git worktree you can diff, keep, recover, merge, or discard. |
| Local cleanup | RunHaven-owned images, volumes, networks, runs, egress logs, and auth-broker state have explicit inspection and cleanup commands. |

RunHaven is not a complete data-loss or exfiltration solution. The selected
agent can still read the mounted workspace and its isolated home volume, and
`internet` mode is not domain-restricted. See the
[security model](docs/SECURITY_MODEL.md) for the full boundary.

## Quick start

Start Apple `container`, then install RunHaven from this checkout:

```bash
container system start
cargo install --path . --locked
```

Run the non-mutating setup guide:

```bash
runhaven setup
```

Build an agent image and sign in once:

```bash
runhaven image build claude
runhaven login claude
```

From the project directory you want the agent to work on, inspect the plan and
run:

```bash
runhaven plan claude
runhaven run claude
```

Or open the terminal UI on an interactive terminal:

```bash
runhaven
```

The TUI is an unreleased RunHaven-only checkpoint over the same Rust backend. It
opens with a launch flow, shows the exact command and safety facts before
launch, requires typed confirmation for lower-security plans, restores the
terminal before starting the agent, and includes active-run summaries,
confirmation-gated log snapshots, run history, preflight diagnostics, and
post-run recovery. It does not replace the CLI: subcommands, pipes, and
redirected invocations still use the CLI directly.

Use the smallest project directory the agent needs. RunHaven mounts that
directory at `/workspace`, not your whole home directory. See
[Installation](docs/INSTALLATION.md) for requirements and
[Usage](docs/USAGE.md) for command-level workflows.

## Signing in

RunHaven never reads your host login state. You sign in once, the credential
lives in an isolated per-agent home volume (or, for Claude, host-side and
injected at run time), and every later run reuses it.

| Agent | Sign in with | How it works |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Claude | `runhaven login claude` | Runs Anthropic's `claude setup-token` on your host (needs Claude Code installed). The token is injected into the sandbox at run time, never written to `~/.claude` and never placed on a command line. |
| Codex | `runhaven login codex` | `codex login --device-auth` inside the sandbox. Enable device-code login in ChatGPT under Settings then Security. |
| Gemini | Isolated in-sandbox login, or API-key broker | Google account OAuth is kept inside the isolated Gemini state volume. Headless API-key runs can use `--api-key-broker-env GEMINI_API_KEY`. |
| Copilot | `runhaven login copilot` | The GitHub device flow inside the sandbox. Answer `y` when it offers to store the token; the file lands in the isolated volume, not on your Mac. |
| Antigravity | `runhaven login antigravity` | Starts `agy`; approve the Google sign-in in your browser, then type `/exit`. |

Each login persists in a per-agent home volume reused across projects
(`--auth-scope agent`, the default), or pass `--auth-scope project` to keep it
to one workspace. Clear a login with `runhaven login <agent> --clear`.

Prefer API keys? A host-side broker keeps the real key on the host and gives the
guest only a placeholder plus a base-URL redirect
(`runhaven run codex --api-key-broker-env OPENAI_API_KEY`). See the
[auth broker](docs/AUTH_BROKER.md) doc.

## Network and egress

RunHaven has three network modes:

| Mode | Use it for | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `provider` | Normal hosted-agent use when provider hosts are bundled. | Managed internal network plus a host-side allowlist proxy for the agent's provider hosts. |
| `internal` | Local-only analysis or tests. | Host-only Apple `container` network with no internet egress. |
| `internet` | Package managers, registries, CDNs, or custom images that need broad internet. | Unrestricted outbound access. |

When you omit `--network`, RunHaven chooses `provider` for profiles with bundled
provider hosts and `internet` for profiles without them. In provider mode, each
agent ships a small maintained allowlist, including narrow domain-family
patterns where needed. If something is blocked, RunHaven says so in plain
language and the per-host detail is in `runhaven egress log`.

## Review and recovery

RunHaven records bounded run metadata without prompts, tokens, environment
values, or file contents, and gives every owned resource an explicit review or
cleanup path:

```bash
runhaven runs active
runhaven runs status <run-id>
runhaven runs logs-follow <run-id>
runhaven runs stop <run-id>
runhaven runs kill <run-id>
runhaven runs repair <run-id>
runhaven runs list
runhaven runs show <run-id>
runhaven runs log <run-id>
runhaven runs diff <run-id>
runhaven runs merge <run-id>
runhaven runs discard <run-id>
runhaven state list
runhaven network list
runhaven image doctor
```

The current TUI exposes active-run summaries, bounded log snapshots only after
you type `logs`, run history without host workspace paths, preflight checks,
secret-free diagnostics, and post-run recovery over the same validated cores.
Stop, kill, repair, diff review, worktree merge/discard, image rebuild, state
cleanup, and network cleanup remain CLI-first today.

## Status and roadmap

RunHaven is alpha/pre-release. `v0.5.0` is the CLI-only pre-release already cut.
This checkout now contains the unreleased RunHaven-only TUI checkpoint as a
first-class reference over the same CLI backend. The Tauri/Svelte desktop shell
is alpha: it can read setup, dashboard, profile, folder-pick, and run-plan state
and supports confirmed launch, image readiness, sanitized live status, bounded
output snapshots, stop, kill, repair, and secret-free diagnostics. Image build,
state cleanup, network cleanup, and worktree review remain CLI-first.

The roadmap now separates the active TUI build from the later desktop release
(full detail in [ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md) and the
[release plan](docs/V1_RELEASE_PLAN.md)):

- **`v0.5.0`, CLI complete:** the command set, docs, JSON and local-data
  decisions, runtime smokes, profile support tiers, diagnostics, cleanup, and
  security boundaries are finished and verified for the CLI-only pre-release.
- **Runtime and security hardening:** completed slices are recorded in the
  roadmap and state files; keep runtime evidence current when the boundary is
  touched.
- **First-class terminal UI, v0.6 active:** a bare interactive
  `runhaven` opens the four-step launch wizard and run manager over the shared
  planner and policy. The CLI stays the complete explicit and automation
  surface.
- **Remaining non-UI scope and CLI public release:** promote one design-first
  item at a time without weakening CLI semantics or default safety.
- **First-class desktop app, later:** the Tauri app becomes the easiest safe
  path for the full workflow, signed and notarized. Its release version label is
  open.

## Product rule

The secure path must be the easy path: secure defaults are the shortest
workflow, supported lower-security choices warn and require explicit intent, and
unsupported, invalid, or hard-boundary violations fail closed. Apple
`container machine` is not the default boundary; explicit or user-managed machine
workflows are warned, not blocked solely for being less secure.

## Development

Agent-assisted work starts from three files only: [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md),
[feature_list.json](feature_list.json), and
[current-state.md](current-state.md). Load the harness docs only when a task
touches that surface.

Use the smallest relevant check for a change:

```bash
cargo fmt --check
cargo test --locked
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo run --locked --bin runhaven-check-pins
npm --prefix ui run check
npm --prefix ui test
npm --prefix ui run test:e2e
git diff --check
```

Full local harness verification is `./init.sh`. Opt-in Apple `container` runtime
smokes are `scripts/apple_container_smoke.sh` (add `--with-provider` for the
egress checks). Docs-only changes use the docs checks from
[the verification matrix](docs/harness/feedback/verification-matrix.md); runtime,
security-boundary, image, or install-flow changes need focused tests plus the
relevant Apple `container` smokes.
