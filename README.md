Run AI coding agents inside Apple `container` on macOS 26+ with a narrow,
previewable local boundary.

RunHaven is for people who should not need to understand containers,
sandboxing, SSH agents, or credential leakage before using Claude Code, Codex,
Gemini, Antigravity, Copilot, or a custom agent on their Mac. It mounts one
selected project, gives the agent one isolated home volume, avoids host
secrets, and shows the exact Apple `container` command before anything runs.

## Status

Early foundation. RunHaven is usable for local testing, image builds, and
provider-restricted agent runs.

RunHaven only supports macOS 26+ on Apple silicon. Windows and Linux are not
supported runtimes or contributor verification targets.

Use `runhaven plan` before `runhaven run`. Treat the default internet network
as unrestricted egress inside whatever Apple `container` and your host network
allow. Use `--network provider` when a run should be restricted to the bundled
provider host allowlist plus any reviewed fully qualified `--provider-host`
entries.

## Quick Start

Install and start Apple `container` first:

```bash
container system start
```

Install RunHaven from this checkout:

```bash
python3.14 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install pip==26.1.2
python -m pip install --no-deps -e .
```

Run the non-mutating setup guide, build an image, inspect the plan, then run
from the project directory you want the agent to work on:

```bash
runhaven setup
runhaven image build claude
runhaven plan claude
runhaven run claude
```

Use the smallest project directory the agent needs. RunHaven mounts that
directory at `/workspace`, not your whole home directory.

See [Installation](docs/INSTALLATION.md) for requirements and development
setup. See [Usage](docs/USAGE.md) for command-level workflows.

## Core Capabilities

- `runhaven plan` prints the workspace, state volume, network mode, egress
  status, preflight setup, and Apple `container run` command before execution.
- `runhaven run` mounts one selected workspace and one isolated per-project
  agent home volume.
- `--session NAME` selects a reusable named project/profile home volume, with
  explicit reset and prune commands.
- Bundled images run as a non-root `agent` user with a read-only root
  filesystem, temporary scratch space, and dropped Linux capabilities.
- `--workspace-scope current|git-root` keeps the default mount narrow and makes
  repository-root expansion explicit.
- `--worktree` runs agents in a RunHaven-owned git worktree so the source
  checkout stays untouched.
- Worktree review commands suggest detected project checks without running
  them automatically.
- `--network internal` supports local-only commands.
- `--network provider` routes normal agent runs through a host-side provider
  host allowlist proxy on an internal Apple `container` network.
- `--ssh` forwards the macOS SSH agent without mounting raw SSH keys.
- `--env NAME` passes one reviewed host environment variable by name; `NAME=value`
  is rejected.
- `runhaven runs ...`, `runhaven egress log`, and `runhaven auth ...` expose
  secret-free run, provider policy, and auth broker diagnostics.

See [Capabilities](docs/CAPABILITIES.md) for the full feature and limitation
overview.

## Supported Agents

```bash
runhaven agents
```

| Profile | Default image | Use case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `claude` | `runhaven/claude:0.1.0` | Claude Code with isolated project state |
| `codex` | `runhaven/codex:0.1.0` | Codex CLI with its own workspace sandbox enabled |
| `gemini` | `runhaven/gemini:0.1.0` | Gemini CLI with project-scoped home state |
| `antigravity` | `runhaven/antigravity:0.1.0` | Antigravity CLI in the same container boundary |
| `copilot` | `runhaven/copilot:0.1.0` | GitHub Copilot CLI with isolated state |
| `shell` | `runhaven/base:0.1.0` | Generic shell profile for custom agent images |

Use `shell` for another agent image:

```bash
runhaven plan shell --image my-agent:2026.06.14 -- my-agent --help
```

## Development

Use the smallest relevant check for a change:

```bash
python -m compileall src tests scripts
PYTHONPATH=src python -m unittest discover -s tests
python scripts/check_pins.py
git diff --check
```

Full local harness verification:

```bash
./init.sh
```

Docs-only changes should use the docs checks from
[the verification matrix](docs/harness/feedback/verification-matrix.md). Runtime,
security boundary, image, or install-flow changes need focused tests plus the
relevant Apple `container` smokes.
