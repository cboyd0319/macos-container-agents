# Current State

Last updated: 2026-06-30 UTC

## Current Objective

The product direction changed on 2026-06-30: stop treating terminal UI
completion as the primary user-facing goal. The secure path should be easiest for
non-technical users through a native-feeling macOS GUI. The CLI remains the
complete technical, automation, recovery, and verification surface. The TUI
should be finished only where it hardens the shared workflow and proves backend
contracts, not polished into a standalone product.

Current branch goal: finish the remaining TUI hardening surfaces already backed
by `runhaven-core`, do one more CLI surface audit, commit and push the branch,
then merge this branch/PR and shift focus to the GUI. Do not publish, tag,
version-bump, or cut a release from this work unless the maintainer explicitly
asks for a release pass.

RunHaven is replacing its previous custom TUI with the pinned upstream Codex
TUI source baseline:

```text
repo: https://github.com/openai/codex.git
commit: 5267e805fb830891c0b23376bcd9cbd382c3473c
path: codex-rs/tui/src/
```

Keep Codex vendoring source-first, RunHaven behavior in thin adapters, shared
data contracts in `runhaven-core`, every culling decision documented, and
user-facing copy plain enough for non-technical users.

## TUI/CLI Hardening Acceptance Scope

Before merge, the terminal checkpoint should cover the RunHaven workflow parts
that harden the shared backend:

- Plain startup: bare interactive `runhaven` opens a calm, nontechnical TUI;
  non-TTY and explicit subcommands stay CLI-first.
- Launch flow: workspace choice, agent choice, network/auth visibility, plan
  review, exact-command review, typed confirmation when required, terminal
  restore, foreground launch handoff, and post-run recovery all work through
  `PreparedLaunch` and `AgentRunPlan`.
- Run operation: active-run status, typed stop/hard-stop/repair controls,
  bounded readable logs, confirmation-gated raw output, failure states, and
  remediation text are visible without exposing workspace paths or secrets.
- Diagnostics: doctor/preflight, provider egress, auth status/log metadata,
  terminal capability status, and common blocked-state guidance are reachable
  from the TUI and stay secret-free.
- Records: history or run-record review is present when existing
  `runhaven-core` data already supports it; otherwise the TUI must state the
  CLI fallback plainly and keep branch scope honest.
- Scope decisions: Cubby/pet behavior, terminal image polish, mascot work,
  Zork, native Codex `App`, and native `ChatWidget` are not blockers for this
  branch. Keep them dormant, parked, or explicitly out of scope unless they
  harden the shared RunHaven workflow.
- Boundary guards: native Codex app-server transport, filesystem RPC, MCP,
  login, workspace command execution, session recording, external editors,
  hooks, broad shell execution, cloud/browser credential access, and
  host-reaching Codex paths remain dormant or fail-closed unless a reviewed
  RunHaven boundary promotes them.
- Verification: the final gate includes fmt, check, `runhaven-tui` tests,
  `codex-vendored-tests` no-run, clippy, pin check, Codex TUI compare, JSON
  validation, snap-new scan, diff check, non-TTY proof, live PTY open/quit
  proof, live or deterministic confirmed-launch proof, and the CLI surface
  check.
- CLI pass: run the existing CLI surface check, inspect command help/output for
  stale TUI/v0.6 wording, and fix any CLI-facing mismatch before merge.
- GUI handoff: after merge, research existing Apple `container` GUI projects on
  GitHub and decide whether to build, adapt, or avoid them before starting the
  native macOS GUI.

## Startup State Contract

- `AGENTS.md`: root instruction map.
- `feature_list.json`: compact feature status and next product slice.
- `current-state.md`: current facts, blockers, and handoff.

Do not recreate separate root `progress.md` or `session-handoff.md` files.
Load deeper docs only when the task touches that surface.

## Product Facts

- RunHaven is a Rust 1.96.0 workspace for running AI coding agents inside Apple
  `container` on macOS 26+ on Apple silicon.
- The `v0.5.0` CLI-complete pre-release was cut and published on 2026-06-26.
- The CLI remains the complete automation and recovery backend.
- The terminal UI is unreleased and active. A bare interactive `runhaven` opens
  the verified RunHaven-only checkpoint; pipes, redirection, and explicit
  subcommands stay CLI-first. The TUI should now be hardened only where it
  strengthens shared RunHaven workflow contracts.
- The alpha desktop shell lives under `ui/` and `src-tauri/`. `src-tauri` is a
  Rust workspace member over typed `runhaven-core` commands. The desktop shell
  remains deferred to a later first-class release phase.
- Windows and Linux are not supported runtime or contributor-verification
  targets.
- GitHub Actions CI is disabled during alpha/pre-release. Local macOS 26+
  verification is authoritative until a maintainer explicitly re-enables CI.

## Rust Source Layout

| Area | Path | Owns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Binary entrypoints | `crates/runhaven/` | `runhaven` and `runhaven-check-pins` startup, including the bare-interactive TUI routing decision. |
| Core library | `crates/runhaven-core/` | Runtime, provider, records, image, doctor, diagnostics, support, harness pin logic, and shared UI contracts. |
| CLI presentation | `crates/runhaven-cli/` | Clap dispatch, setup text, and human CLI output. |
| Terminal UI | `crates/runhaven-tui/` | Codex-vendored TUI source plus RunHaven TUI adapters. |
| Desktop Rust shell | `src-tauri/` | Narrow typed Tauri commands over `runhaven-core`. |
| Frontend | `ui/` | Alpha Svelte desktop UI. |

`crates/runhaven` is binary-only. Do not rebuild a root compatibility facade.
Shared runtime truth belongs in `runhaven-core`; presentation belongs in CLI,
TUI, Tauri, or frontend layers.

## Key Decisions

- Secure defaults must be the easiest path. Supported lower-security choices
  warn and require explicit intent. Unsupported or hard-boundary violations
  fail closed.
- Default runs use task-scoped `container run`, not `container machine`,
  because normal machine workflows can expose host home and credentials.
  Explicit or user-managed machine workflows are not blocked solely for being
  less secure, but any RunHaven machine integration must warn and require
  intent.
- Do not mount host home directories, cloud credential folders, raw SSH keys,
  browser profiles, or arbitrary host environment variables by default.
- `--ssh` remains fail-closed. Apple `container` 1.0.0 exposes the forwarded
  socket to the non-root guest, but `ssh-add -l` returns permission denied.
  Reopen only with a no-secret runtime proof.
- Provider egress stays default-deny in provider mode. Agent provider domains
  can be expressed as reviewed stable domain-family patterns, but data-egress
  hosts stay closed by not being in the allowlist.
- Log sanitization and host-held secret storage are separate non-TUI security
  slices. Because RunHaven is macOS 26+ only, RunHaven-owned host secrets should
  prefer macOS Keychain where practical. This does not authorize reading
  provider-owned Keychain items, browser profiles, cloud credential stores, or
  arbitrary host credentials.
- TUI image and pet rendering must follow Codex source behavior. Use the pinned
  upstream Codex TUI source and local Codex config evidence before writing custom pet,
  terminal image, statusline, bottom-pane, keymap, title, or resume behavior.
  Cubby, pet polish, mascot work, and terminal image polish are parked, not part
  of this branch's hardening checkpoint. Keep existing pet code as source-first
  infrastructure; do not add a live env-gated smoke path unless a future
  explicitly scoped TUI or GUI slice needs it.
- TUI implementation slices should use the repo-local
  `.agents/skills/codex-tui` skill first. It requires the Persona Codex TUI
  skill (`/Users/c/Documents/GitHub/persona/content/skills/codex-tui`), then
  `rust` and `adversarial-review` as the end-of-slice gate before commit: Rust
  crate/tooling correctness, Codex source-pattern alignment, then boundary and
  overclaim review.
- Antigravity (`agy`) is research-only in this repo. Do not use it for
  end-of-slice code review, adversarial review, verification, or proof of
  correctness.
- For Codex-vendored TUI and `codex-*` dependencies, preserving the original
  Codex package name, crate name, and module path is the default. Use a local
  bridge only when compiling or activating the real Codex surface would cross a
  RunHaven security boundary that has not been designed and tested.
- User-facing writing is product behavior. UI text, menus, prompts, warnings,
  README/usage docs, and setup instructions target non-technical users at about
  an 8th grade reading level.
- The hidden Zork I easter egg remains wanted. The current reset keeps the
  MIT-licensed `historicalsource/zork1` collection under `third_party/zork1/`.
  The earlier Ferrif-derived TUI engine was removed with the old custom TUI and
  is recoverable from git history. If reintroduced, it must stay TUI-local,
  attributed, offline, and carefully validate save/restore files. Defer it to a
  future explicitly scoped polish or easter-egg slice.
- The glib advisory GHSA-wrw7-89jp-8q8g remains treated as not affected because
  `glib` enters only through Tauri's Linux GTK backend and is absent from the
  macOS build graph. See `docs/PINNING.md`.

## Latest Verified Work

2026-06-27: Workspace crate split complete. The Rust codebase now uses
workspace crates:

- `crates/runhaven` for binary entrypoints.
- `crates/runhaven-core` for shared runtime truth and UI contracts.
- `crates/runhaven-cli` for CLI presentation.
- `crates/runhaven-tui` for the Codex-vendored TUI.
- `src-tauri` as a workspace member.

This phase also removed the obsolete separate Tauri lockfile, made root Cargo
commands cover Tauri, narrowed public crate exports, kept `runhaven`
binary-only, and refreshed active architecture, harness, pinning, TUI, and
state docs to the new layout.

Follow-up ownership audit fix: `crates/runhaven` now owns the bare-interactive
TUI routing decision, `crates/runhaven-cli` no longer depends on
`crates/runhaven-tui`, the unused `records::history` compatibility alias is
gone, `init.sh` uses `cargo test -p runhaven-tui --locked` as the TUI package
gate, and empty untracked vendored snapshot directories were removed from the
local tree. Dormant vendored Codex test modules remain source-first until their
parent modules are wired back into the RunHaven TUI app shell.

Repo-wide organization audit follow-up: tracked source is now clean of root
`src/`, tracked build output, `.snap` files, `.DS_Store`, and the obsolete
`src-tauri/Cargo.lock`. The largest visible directory clutter was ignored local
build output, not tracked source. Tauri npm scripts now set
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR` to the absolute root `target/` path so desktop builds use
the root workspace target directory. The stale ignored `src-tauri/target/`,
frontend `dist/`, Playwright
reports, test results, and empty `.github/workflows/` directory were removed
locally. `docs/harness/state/clean-state-checklist.md` records which ignored
directories are allowed caches and which should be cleaned when they appear.
Active stale doc paths were corrected in the research and Tauri/TUI design docs;
historical evidence logs were left as records of what happened at the time.

TUI native-pet image smoke follow-up (superseded): the earlier temporary
`app_shell.rs` image-smoke path has been removed from the active shell during
core-completion cleanup. RunHaven still bundles the verified Cubby Codex pet
package from `docs/assets/installed-pet/cubby/` and can materialize it as
`custom:runhaven-cubby` under `$CODEX_HOME/pets/runhaven-cubby/` through the
lower pet modules, avoiding collisions with a user's own
`$CODEX_HOME/pets/cubby/` package. Reintroduce terminal-image smoke only in a
future explicitly scoped pet, terminal-image, or GUI asset slice.

TUI component-seam follow-up: `crates/runhaven-core/src/ui_contracts.rs` now
defines the first tagged RunHaven payload enum with `AgentCatalogData` and
`LaunchPlanData`; `LaunchPlanData` includes the planner's auth scope so the TUI
does not guess whether login state is agent-wide or project-scoped. Fixtures live under
`crates/runhaven-core/tests/fixtures/ui/`. The temporary TUI adapter consumes
`AgentCatalogItemData` for agent display, but the next visual slice should move
toward a Codex-native shell with RunHaven product cards. dbt-wizard is only the
architecture proof for stable domain payloads first and renderer second. The
visual target is closer to native Codex: compact intro and status content,
bottom composer and status line, and no analytics dashboard feel in the default
launcher. Native Cubby behavior is parked unless a future TUI or GUI slice
explicitly pulls it forward.

TUI bottom-pane follow-up: `crates/runhaven-tui` now compiles the Codex
`ListSelectionView` family directly from the vendored bottom-pane source through
a narrow staging facade. The facade exposes the Codex-shaped event sender, list
keymap, paste normalization, cancellation, and completion types needed by
`ListSelectionView` and the pet picker. Its default list keymap now mirrors the
upstream Codex list defaults. The upstream Codex list-selection snapshot tests
are gated behind the opt-in `codex-vendored-tests` feature until RunHaven
intentionally vendors or regenerates those snapshot goldens.

TUI launch-picker follow-up: `app_shell.rs` no longer owns a hand-drawn
Ratatui agent list or preview pane. It now hosts a RunHaven launch-wizard view
model under `crates/runhaven-tui/src/tui/runhaven/launch_wizard.rs`, rendered
through Codex `SelectionViewParams` and `ListSelectionView`. The generic picker
logic, side-content layout, cancellation, and list key handling remain
Codex-vendored. RunHaven-owned code maps `AgentCatalogData` and
`LaunchPlanData` into decision rows and a short safety header. The first agent
chooser intentionally does not show a side plan preview, exact command, broker
detail, image detail, or provider-host list. That dense safety information
belongs in the review and confirmation steps, where the user checks it before
launch.

TUI launch-review follow-up: Enter on a ready agent now opens a read-only review
step rendered through the Codex menu-surface style. The review shows the
selected agent, auth scope, network posture, workspace mount, state volume,
non-shared host data, provider hosts, safety notes, and exact `container run`
command. `b`, backspace, or Esc returns to the picker; `q` exits from either
screen. Blocked plans cannot open review. At that review slice, launch and
preflight execution were still disabled; later confirmation and foreground
handoff follow-ups supersede that state.

TUI shell-chrome follow-up: the temporary app shell now reserves a real Codex
footer area around the launch picker and review screen. The footer is rendered
through Codex's vendored `bottom_pane/footer.rs` with a RunHaven status line
showing step, selected agent, network posture, boundary, and `? help`. The
shell also uses Codex's sanitized `terminal_title.rs` writer so terminal tab
titles track the workspace, step, and selected agent, and clears the managed
title on exit. The vendored footer snapshot tests are gated behind
`codex-vendored-tests`, matching the list-selection snapshot policy because
upstream `.snap` goldens are intentionally not tracked.

TUI launch-confirmation follow-up: the launch wizard now has Step 4 confirmation
on top of the current Codex menu-surface review. Enter from review opens
confirmation, and the confirmation screen keeps the exact planner command
visible while using `LaunchPlanData.confirm_required` as the only typed-confirm
gate. Plans that need extra intent now use the vendored Codex `TextArea`
editor primitive for the confirmation phrase. While that text field is focused,
plain `q` and `?` are text input instead of shell shortcuts; Esc returns to
review. Paste is ignored for the lower-security confirmation phrase so the
extra intent still means typing. Secure/default plans still confirm with Enter
and keep `q` as the shell quit shortcut. At that point launch was still
disabled; the later foreground launch handoff supersedes the no-launch
behavior.

TUI confirm-composer follow-up: `crates/runhaven-tui` now compiles the vendored
Codex `bottom_pane/textarea.rs` and `bottom_pane/textarea/vim.rs` through the
staging facade. The facade has the Codex editor/Vim keymap defaults, and the
byte-range text element types now come from the real vendored `codex-protocol`
crate. The upstream deterministic textarea tests run by default; the snapshot
and randomized stress tests remain opt-in with the same `codex-vendored-tests`
policy as the other upstream snapshot goldens.

TUI capabilities-doc follow-up: `docs/plans/codex-tui-capabilities.md` now
locks the full local Codex TUI capability survey into repo docs. Use it as the
source map before custom TUI work. It confirms Codex already has mature terminal
runtime, bottom-pane/composer, keymap, selection popup, approval, markdown,
diff, streaming, history-cell, session, status, pet, terminal-title, and
VT100/snapshot-test systems.

TUI architecture correction: the deeper read of
`/Users/c/Downloads/codex-tui-capabilities.md` showed that the full
`ChatComposer` is not the next isolated seam unless RunHaven only uses the small
`public_widgets::ComposerInput` wrapper. Native Codex TUI behavior is built as
`Tui` runtime plus `App` event loop plus `ChatWidget` plus `BottomPane`, with
`app_server_session.rs` owning typed client calls so transport plumbing stays out
of `App` and `ChatWidget`. The current 2026-06-29 RunHaven direction uses the
source-first pieces needed for the scoped MVP: Codex `Tui`, event stream,
`BottomPane`, typed facade, RunHaven-owned views, active-run logs, diagnostics,
and recovery. Native `App` and `ChatWidget` are separate optional future
promotions, not default MVP parity work. Host-reaching Codex RPCs such as remote
filesystem, MCP, and IDE actions stay fail-closed unless a RunHaven security
design explicitly promotes them.

Strategy decision: RunHaven is following the capability guide's Strategy C path,
a Codex-compatible client, because its domain is close to Codex's
agent/thread/turn/session model. Strategy B, extracting a small TUI kit, is only
a temporary compile bridge for low-coupling modules such as `ComposerInput`,
wrapping, diff rendering, or selection helpers. It is not the product
architecture.

Strategy C Phase 3 runtime-spine follow-up: `crates/runhaven-tui` now compiles
the vendored Codex `tui.rs` runtime spine as `codex_runtime`, including the
event stream, frame requester, frame limiter, Unix job-control hook, terminal
stderr guard, custom terminal, insert-history writer, notifications, and
terminal hyperlinks. The new `runhaven/app_server_session.rs` bridge routes
supported bootstrap, agent-catalog, and workspace-validation calls into the
local RunHaven facade and keeps unsupported Codex method families typed and
fail-closed. Required dependency changes are exact-pinned: crossterm now enables
the upstream event-stream and bracketed-paste features, Ratatui enables
scrolling regions, and `tokio-stream` plus `derive_more` are direct workspace
dependencies for the compiled Codex runtime surface. Later slices activated the
Codex runtime for the scoped MVP; native `App` remains dormant unless RunHaven
needs Codex app-loop ownership behind reviewed boundaries.

Latest harness review:

- 2026-06-27: Reviewed
  `/Users/c/Documents/GitHub/learn-harness-engineering/docs/en/resources/`,
  including the minimal templates, reference notes, OpenAI advanced pack, SOPs,
  and repo-template docs. Decision: keep RunHaven's three-file startup contract
  and map external template concepts onto existing RunHaven owners instead of
  adding parallel root progress/handoff, quality, reliability, plan, or product
  spec files. Verified with pin check, JSON validation, typography scan over
  changed files, and `git diff --check`.

Latest TUI strategy review:

- 2026-06-27: Fully read `/Users/c/Downloads/codex-tui-capabilities.md` and
  checked the conclusion against local Codex source entrypoints for
  `app_server_session`, `App`, `ChatWidget`, `BottomPane`, `Tui`,
  `TuiEventStream`, and `FrameRequester`. Decision: RunHaven should follow the
  Strategy C compatible-client path, with Strategy B limited to temporary
  bridges and low-coupling helpers. Verified with `jq empty feature_list.json`,
  `git diff --check`, and a no-em-dash typography scan over changed docs/state
  files.

Latest Strategy C plan import:

- 2026-06-27: Imported the split Strategy C plan from
  `/Users/c/Downloads/runhaven-codex-tui-strategy-c/` into
  `docs/plans/codex-tui-strategy-c/`. Read all five plan files and ran
  read-only adversarial, Rust architecture, and Rust test-architecture reviews.
  The repo copy incorporates the review fixes: do not broadly add Codex backend
  crates as workspace authorities; compile the dormant runtime spine before
  terminal handoff; keep `launch_wizard.rs` UI-owned while the service returns
  payloads/events; keep upstream `.snap` files external by default; add
  deterministic facade, fail-closed, terminal handoff, workspace-gate, and
  snapshot-matrix requirements; prepare foreground launch through the facade but
  execute `launch_run_plan` on the UI thread only after terminal restore; keep
  the hidden Zork easter egg as a future RunHaven-owned Codex-shaped view.

Latest TUI Phase 0 baseline lock:

- 2026-06-27: Completed Phase 0 of the Strategy C plan without runtime behavior
  changes. `crates/runhaven-tui/src/tui/README.md` now records the upstream
  Codex GitHub repo, pinned commit
  `5267e805fb830891c0b23376bcd9cbd382c3473c`, upstream path
  `codex-rs/tui/src/`, RunHaven-only files, and copied Codex files with local
  edits. Added `scripts/compare-codex-tui.sh`, which fetches the pinned
  upstream Codex source from GitHub into a temporary checkout and compares all
  files under `codex-rs/tui/src/`, including Rust files, `src/bin`, nested
  tests, and `.snap` goldens. Phase 0 audit snapshot: 894 upstream files, 364
  RunHaven files, 356 common paths, 538 upstream `.snap` files external by
  default, 8 RunHaven-only files, and 20 copied Codex files with local edits.
  Verified:
  `bash -n scripts/compare-codex-tui.sh`,
  `scripts/compare-codex-tui.sh`,
  `scripts/compare-codex-tui.sh --list-missing`,
  `cargo run --locked --bin runhaven-check-pins --quiet`,
  `jq empty feature_list.json`,
  `python3 -m json.tool feature_list.json`, whitespace and ASCII scans, and
  `git diff --check`.

Latest TUI Phase 1 service extraction:

- 2026-06-27: Completed Phase 1 of the Strategy C plan. `app_shell.rs` no
  longer calls `runhaven-core` planner/profile APIs directly. The temporary
  RunHaven TUI service in `crates/runhaven-tui/src/tui/runhaven/service.rs`
  builds launch preview payloads from core profiles and `LaunchPlanData`, keeps
  per-agent planner errors typed, and leaves
  `crates/runhaven-tui/src/tui/runhaven/launch_wizard.rs` as the UI-owned view
  model over Codex `ListSelectionView`. Service tests cover agent-name
  mapping, default network and auth scope, provider metadata, shell internet
  confirmation, shared agent state volumes, nested git workspace notes, and
  fail-per-agent missing-workspace errors. Phase 1 audit snapshot: 894 upstream
  files, 365 RunHaven files, 356 common paths, 538 upstream `.snap` files
  external by default, 9 RunHaven-only files, and 20 copied Codex files with
  local edits.

Latest TUI Phase 2 backend facade:

- 2026-06-27: Completed Phase 2 of the Strategy C plan. Added the local
  Codex-shaped request, event, server-request, validation, and disabled-method
  contract in `crates/runhaven-tui/src/tui/runhaven/protocol.rs`. Added the
  bounded in-process client facade in
  `crates/runhaven-tui/src/tui/runhaven/app_server_client.rs` with
  `request_typed`, `next_event`, `shutdown`, a cloneable request handle,
  request cancellation, server-request resolve/reject methods, lossless
  transcript/completion/launch-prepared event delivery, and best-effort
  progress/log dropping with lag markers. `RunHavenTuiService` now dispatches
  neutral facade requests for agent catalog and workspace validation while
  keeping the temporary launch-preview payload for the staging shell. The
  request worker spawns service work off the command loop, matching Codex's
  non-blocking client shape for future interactive flows. Focused facade tests
  cover the Phase 2 matrix, including the fail-closed disabled method families.

Latest TUI Strategy C drift correction:

- 2026-06-27: Imported
  `docs/plans/codex-tui-strategy-c/05-adversarial-drift-ledger.md` and restored
  the plan's vendor-first wording at that time. The 2026-06-29 MVP-first
  direction now supersedes native `App` and `ChatWidget` as default next
  targets; they remain optional promotions behind reviewed boundaries.
  `tui/mod.rs` now has guard tests that fail if dormant host-reaching Codex
  surfaces are declared before their risky upstream markers are removed or
  fail-closed.

Latest TUI staging-facade shrink:

- 2026-06-27: Removed the inline `codex_protocol::user_input` shim from
  `crates/runhaven-tui/src/tui/mod.rs` and first replaced it with file-backed
  staged leaves under `crates/runhaven-tui/src/tui/codex_protocol/`. Added drift
  guards so `mod.rs` cannot grow new inline staging modules, new `codex_*`
  self-aliases, or a native `app` declaration that still routes `run()` through
  `app_shell::run()`.
- 2026-06-29: Moved the `tui/mod.rs` drift and security guard tests into
  `tui/drift_tests.rs`. This keeps the same guard coverage while shrinking
  `tui/mod.rs` to declarations plus the TUI entrypoint. The only remaining
  inline staging module in `tui/mod.rs` is the narrow `onboarding` hyperlink
  shim, and the guard still fails if new inline staging modules are added.

Latest Codex protocol crate vendoring:

- 2026-06-27: Began real `codex-*` crate vendoring under original package and
  library names. Added `crates/codex/` workspace members for
  `codex-protocol`, `codex-app-server-protocol`, and their first dependency
  closure: `codex-async-utils`, `codex-execpolicy`,
  `codex-experimental-api-macros`, `codex-network-proxy`,
  `codex-shell-command`, and the required `codex-utils-*` crates. Vendored
  crate manifests use explicit Apache-2.0, `0.0.0`, and `publish = false`
  local metadata, keep internal `codex-*` paths relative, preserve the upstream
  `runfiles` git rev for schema fixture tests, and align only external exact
  pins that Cargo's unified workspace resolver cannot hold twice. `runhaven-tui`
  now depends on the real vendored `codex-protocol` and
  `codex-app-server-protocol` crates, and the active `TextArea` path consumes
  `ByteRange` and `TextElement` from `codex_protocol::user_input`. Deleted the
  local `tui/codex_protocol/` staged leaf. Verified so far:
  `cargo check -p codex-protocol`, `cargo check -p codex-app-server-protocol`,
  `cargo check -p runhaven-tui --locked`,
  `cargo test -p codex-protocol --locked --quiet`,
  `cargo test -p codex-app-server-protocol --locked --quiet`, and
  `cargo test -p runhaven-tui --locked drift_tests -- --nocapture`.

Latest TUI Phase 3 runtime and handoff gate:

- 2026-06-27: Completed the terminal-handoff proof without wiring real agent
  launch. `Tui::with_restored(...)` now has deterministic sequencing tests
  for normal and alt-screen handoff, including child-error resume. The event
  broker has a pause/drop/resume regression to prove events sent while the
  source is dropped do not leak into the resumed TUI. Added the local
  `runhaven/terminal_handoff.rs` smoke hook, gated by
  `RUNHAVEN_TUI_HANDOFF_SMOKE=success|error`, which initializes the Codex
  runtime, clears managed terminal title and pet image state before handoff,
  runs only a harmless foreground child or an intentional missing child, restores
  terminal ownership, and exits. Ambient and picker-preview pet image state now
  share a combined cleanup helper, including native `App` shutdown. Phase 3
  audit snapshot: 894 upstream files, 370 RunHaven files, 356 common
  paths, 538 upstream `.snap` files external by default, 14 RunHaven-only files,
  and 53 copied Codex files with local edits.

Latest Codex config/keymap crate vendoring:

- 2026-06-27: Continued real `codex-*` crate vendoring under original package
  and library names. Added workspace members for `codex-config`,
  `codex-api`, `codex-client`, `codex-features`, `codex-file-system`,
  `codex-git-utils`, `codex-model-provider-info`, `codex-otel`, and
  `codex-utils-path`, plus their local manifest wiring. `runhaven-tui` now
  depends on the real vendored `codex-config` crate, `lib.rs` no longer aliases
  `codex_config`, and the file-backed vendored `keymap.rs` compiles against
  `codex_config::types::{KeybindingsSpec, TuiKeymap, MAX_FUNCTION_KEY}` instead
  of an inline RunHaven keymap extract.
- Preserved upstream OpenAI fork git revs for `tokio-tungstenite` and
  `tungstenite` because Codex relies on those forks for proxy-enabled websocket
  behavior. `codex-client` pins `sha2` 0.10 because that source formats the
  digest with the 0.10 trait behavior; RunHaven-owned code keeps its existing
  `sha2` 0.11 pin.
- The active RunHaven launch/security authority is unchanged. These crates are
  vendored source authorities for TUI config/keymap/protocol types, not a
  promotion of Codex auth, filesystem RPC, app-server, or network client
  behavior into the active RunHaven runtime.
- `scripts/compare-codex-tui.sh` now compares deterministic file manifests
  instead of looping over `cmp` calls. Each manifest records relative path, byte
  size, and SHA-256, and `--write-manifests <dir>` writes the upstream/local
  manifests plus missing, local-only, common, and changed lists for audit.
- Verified:
  `cargo metadata --locked --no-deps --format-version 1`,
  `cargo check -p codex-config --locked`,
  `cargo check -p runhaven-tui --locked`,
  `cargo test -p runhaven-tui --locked keymap --quiet`,

  `scripts/compare-codex-tui.sh --write-manifests <tempdir>`.

Latest Codex event-data crate vendoring:

- 2026-06-27: Continued real `codex-*` crate vendoring for the next
  `app_event.rs` activation. Added workspace members for `codex-connectors`,
  `codex-file-search`, `codex-plugin`, and
  `codex-utils-approval-presets`, plus the required plugin namespace closure:
  `codex-utils-plugins`, `codex-exec-server`,
  `codex-exec-server-protocol`, `codex-sandboxing`, `codex-utils-pty`, and
  `codex-windows-sandbox`.
- `runhaven-tui` now depends on the real vendored connector, file-search,
  plugin, and approval-preset crates so the real vendored `app_event.rs`
  imports have crate authority available. `app_event.rs` itself remains
  dormant until its shared TUI types are exposed without activating
  host-reaching Codex app paths.
- Added the same `tokio-tungstenite` and `tungstenite` crates.io patches used
  by upstream Codex, and pinned `codex-exec-server` to upstream Codex's
  `axum` 0.8.8. This avoids carrying an extra registry websocket stack
  (`tokio-tungstenite` 0.29) beside Codex's patched 0.28 fork.
- The active RunHaven launch/security authority is unchanged. These crates are
  vendored source authorities for TUI event-data compatibility, not a promotion
  of Codex exec-server, filesystem RPC, app-server, sandbox launch, plugin
  execution, or connector network behavior into the active RunHaven runtime.
- Local manifest integration found by the end-of-slice adversarial pass:
  `codex-plugin` allows Clippy's `result_large_err`, matching existing
  package-level exceptions in other vendored Codex crates and preserving
  upstream source under RunHaven's stricter `-D warnings` gate.
- The same adversarial pass found loose version specs inherited in target/dev
  dependency sections of new vendored manifests; they were tightened to exact
  pins before commit.
- Focused Cargo efficiency note: use one umbrella `cargo check -p runhaven-tui`
  after dependency graph changes, then rerun `cargo check -p runhaven-tui
  --locked`. Avoid parallel Cargo checks; they serialize behind package-cache
  and build-directory locks and are slower than one incremental umbrella check.

  (expected no package match), and
  `cargo tree -p runhaven-tui --locked -i tokio-tungstenite@0.28.0`.

Latest Codex event-bus activation:

- 2026-06-27: Activated the real vendored `app_event.rs` and
  `app_event_sender.rs` files. The four-variant inline `AppEvent` shim and the
  inline optional-channel `AppEventSender` shim are gone.
- Added `app_event_shared.rs` as a narrow inert leaf-type bridge for
  `AppServerStartedThread`, `UserMessage`, `GoalDraft`, `HistoryCell`,
  `StatusLineGitSummary`, hook trust updates, workspace headline results, and
  no-op session logging while the owning modules remain dormant. This is
  temporary bridge debt, not product behavior.
- `runhaven-tui` now directly depends on `codex-features` and
  `codex-utils-absolute-path` because the real event bus imports those
  authorities directly.
- The temporary launch wizard now gives `ListSelectionView` a real
  `AppEventSender` backed by a scratch channel instead of relying on a local
  `Default` implementation that does not exist upstream.
- Verified:
  `cargo fmt --check`,
  `cargo check -p runhaven-tui --locked`,

  `git diff --check`.

Latest Codex bottom-pane activation:

- 2026-06-27: Promoted the real vendored `bottom_pane/mod.rs` source under its
  original module path and added the original-name crate authorities needed by
  that surface: `codex-core-skills`, `codex-feedback`,
  `codex-models-manager`, and `codex-utils-fuzzy-match`.
- The default remains original Codex package, crate, and module names. Local
  bridges are exceptions only when activating the real surface would cross an
  unreviewed RunHaven security boundary or pull host-reaching behavior into the
  active TUI. The latest TUI sections below are authoritative for current
  named bridge exceptions; at this point in the history they included
  `app_event_shared.rs`, `status`, `onboarding`, and the narrow exposed
  surfaces inside `codex-core-skills`, `codex-feedback`, and
  `codex-models-manager`.
  `codex-feedback::FeedbackDiagnostics::collect_from_env()` is kept
  shape-compatible but returns no diagnostics until RunHaven has a redaction
  policy for host environment capture.
- Snapshot-heavy upstream bottom-pane tests are gated behind
  `codex-vendored-tests`; default RunHaven tests do not create `.snap.new`
  files from external Codex goldens. The opt-in feature still compiles as a
  vendored-source check.
- `scripts/compare-codex-tui.sh` now reports 894 upstream files, 370 RunHaven
  TUI files, 356 shared paths, 538 external upstream `.snap` goldens, 14
  RunHaven-only files, and 43 copied Codex files with local edits.
- Native Codex `App` remains inactive because its owning app/session/chat
  paths still include host environment, filesystem RPC, onboarding auth,
  external editor, clipboard, and hooks surfaces that need RunHaven-specific
  fail-closed design before activation.
- Verified so far:

  `git diff --check`, and
  `scripts/compare-codex-tui.sh`.

Latest Codex utility crate vendoring:

- 2026-06-27: Added original-name vendored workspace crates for
  `codex-utils-cli`, `codex-utils-elapsed`, and
  `codex-utils-sleep-inhibitor`, copied from the pinned local Codex source.
  `runhaven-tui` now depends on those authorities for dormant Codex TUI CLI,
  history, exec-cell, and chat turn-lifecycle imports.
- `codex-utils-sleep-inhibitor` has a scoped `unsafe_code = "allow"` lint
  exception because the upstream macOS implementation uses native IOKit power
  assertion FFI. The exception is local to that vendored utility crate and does
  not change RunHaven runtime safety boundaries.
- A direct `chatwidget` module declaration was tested and reverted before this
  commit because it exposed the pending shared closure rather than a clean
  activation point: real `ChatWidget` and `status` still require more of
  Codex's `legacy_core::config::Config` and app-server shape. `history_cell`
  has since been promoted through the reduced config boundary. Do not replace
  that with another custom RunHaven TUI stand-in.
- 2026-06-29: Promoted the real vendored Codex `history_cell/*`,
  `diff_render.rs`, `exec_cell/*`, `markdown*.rs`, `session_state.rs`,
  `tooltips.rs`, `update_action.rs`, and related root-module aliases out of the
  inert `app_event_shared.rs` bridge. Added original-name `codex-ansi-escape`
  plus the upstream markdown/diff/tooltip dependency closure and the upstream
  `tooltips.txt` asset. The reduced `codex-core` config now loads the
  upstream `tui.show_tooltips` field so session tooltip suppression follows the
  same setting. Two small source exceptions remain: update notices use plain
  Ratatui `Line`/`Text` construction because upstream `ratatui-macros` targets
  Ratatui 0.29, and yolo mode reads RunHaven's reduced Codex config shape until
  full Codex core config is promoted. The full upstream `history_cell/tests.rs`
  module remains parked because it currently requires full Codex config/MCP
  surfaces and snapshot goldens that are not promoted; default tests cover the
  reduced tooltip/config seams, yolo-mode mapping, basic diff rendering, decoded
  local-link control stripping, terminal print-boundary control stripping, and
  ANSI-output degradation.

Latest Codex terminal-detection crate vendoring:

- 2026-06-28: Promoted `codex-terminal-detection` from the temporary
  `runhaven-tui` self-alias to a real original-name vendored crate under
  `crates/codex/terminal-detection`. The copied source and tests are
  byte-identical to the pinned local Codex source. `runhaven-tui` now depends
  on the crate directly, and the duplicate local `terminal_detection.rs` and
  `terminal_tests.rs` files were deleted. This removes the last `codex_*`
  self-alias from `runhaven-tui` without changing active TUI behavior.
- Verified:
  `cargo check -p codex-terminal-detection --locked`,

Latest Codex config support crate vendoring:

- 2026-06-28: Added original-name vendored workspace crates for
  `codex-context-fragments`, `codex-install-context`,
  `codex-memories-read`, `codex-response-debug-context`,
  `codex-utils-output-truncation`, and `codex-utils-stream-parser`. These are
  low-coupling upstream support crates for the next reduced `codex-core`
  config compatibility closure. They are not active RunHaven product authority,
  and `runhaven-tui` does not route launch, install, memory, response-debug,
  app-server, login, MCP, or filesystem behavior through them in this slice.
- Added two drift guards: local `legacy_core` compatibility shims are blocked,
  and `app_event_shared.rs` may shrink but cannot grow new bridge modules or
  host-reaching behavior.
- Full upstream `codex-app-server-client` and full upstream `codex-core` remain
  intentionally inactive. The next useful step is the reduced original-name
  `codex-core` config compatibility closure, not promoting the app-server
  backend stack.
- Verified:

Latest Codex reduced core config authority:

- 2026-06-28: Added `crates/codex/core` as an original-name reduced
  `codex-core` workspace crate for the config compatibility path needed by
  native `App`/`ChatWidget` promotion. It exposes config-facing source-shaped
  surfaces, including terminal resize reflow, bootstrap keyring resolution,
  exec-policy warning/loading placeholders, Windows sandbox config helpers, and
  small path/unified-exec constants.
- This is not full Codex backend activation. The crate deliberately omits
  app-server, login, MCP, filesystem RPC, hooks, tools, rollout, state, and
  session runtime modules until RunHaven designs and verifies those boundaries.
  Guard tests prevent those backend dependencies/modules and block
  RunHaven-owned TUI adapters from importing `codex_core` runtime surfaces.
- Verified so far:
  `cargo fmt --check`,
  `cargo test -p codex-core --locked --quiet`,
  `cargo check -p codex-core --locked`,

  `find crates/runhaven-tui/src/tui -name '*.snap.new' -print`, and
  `git diff --check`.

Latest Codex reduced app-server client compatibility authority:

- 2026-06-28: Added `crates/codex/app-server-client` as an original-name
  reduced `codex-app-server-client` workspace crate. It exposes only the
  upstream-shaped `codex_app_server_client::legacy_core` re-export backed by
  reduced `codex-core`. It deliberately omits app-server transport, remote
  clients, in-process client startup, login, MCP, filesystem RPC, exec-server,
  rollout, state, and thread-store behavior.
- A direct real `status`/`history_cell` activation was tested and reverted in
  the working tree because it cascaded into `ChatWidget` and richer config
  methods before the bottom pane ownership slice was ready. `history_cell` has
  since been promoted through the reduced config boundary. Under the current
  MVP-first direction, future `ChatWidget` work should stay dormant unless
  RunHaven needs source-shaped transcript ownership and can keep native `App`,
  real app-server session, and app-server transport host-reaching behavior
  fail-closed or behind reviewed boundaries.
- Verified so far:
  `cargo check -p codex-app-server-client --offline`,
  `cargo test -p codex-app-server-client --locked --quiet`,
  `cargo check -p runhaven-tui --offline`, and
  `cargo test -p runhaven-tui --locked drift_tests --quiet`.

Latest TUI native bottom-pane ownership:

- 2026-06-28: The live staging `app_shell.rs` now hosts `LaunchWizardView`
  inside the real vendored `BottomPane`. Key events, paste, render, cursor
  placement, frame scheduling, selected-index lookup, terminal title, footer
  status, text-input routing, and footer help now flow through `BottomPane` or
  defaulted `BottomPaneView` contracts instead of direct launch-wizard
  ownership.
- At that point, confirmation was still read-only and the view completed only
  on cancel. The later foreground launch handoff supersedes that behavior.
  Native `App`, `ChatWidget`, real `app_server_session`, and app-server
  transport remain dormant until host-reaching surfaces are removed,
  fail-closed, or routed through reviewed RunHaven boundaries.
- Verified so far:
  `cargo fmt --check`,

  `find crates/runhaven-tui/src/tui -name '*.snap.new' -print`,
  `scripts/compare-codex-tui.sh`, and
  `git diff --check`.

Latest TUI Codex runtime ownership:

- 2026-06-29: The live staging `app_shell.rs` now initializes and restores the
  real vendored Codex `Tui` runtime instead of using `ratatui::try_init()` and
  raw `crossterm::event::poll/read`. Its active loop consumes
  `TuiEventStream`, draws through `Tui::draw`, and shares the Codex
  `FrameRequester` with the hosted `BottomPane`. The earlier Cubby image-smoke
  path is no longer active.
- This preserved the launch picker, review, and confirmation behavior from
  that earlier disabled-launch phase. Native `App`, `ChatWidget`, real
  `app_server_session`, and app-server transport remain dormant until
  host-reaching surfaces are removed, fail-closed, or routed through reviewed
  RunHaven boundaries.
- Verified so far:
  `cargo fmt --check`,

  `git diff --check`.

Latest ChatWidget status-source promotion:

- 2026-06-29: Promoted the real vendored Codex `branch_summary.rs` and the
  `workspace_command.rs` contract for the next ChatWidget status-line path.
  `app_event_shared.rs` no longer owns the `StatusLineGitSummary` bridge; it
  re-exports the real upstream type from `branch_summary.rs`.
- This does not activate Codex app-server transport or host command execution.
  The upstream `AppServerWorkspaceCommandRunner` remains compiled dormant in
  `workspace_command.rs`, and a drift guard blocks `app_shell.rs` plus
  RunHaven-owned adapters from using it in this slice. `branch_summary.rs`

Latest repo-local agent harness audit:

- 2026-06-29: Deep review of `.agents/` found that
  `.agents/skills/codex-tui` is now a full repo-local TUI routing skill.
  `AGENTS.md`, this file, repo-local skills, and focused harness docs now
  describe `.agents/skills/` as on-demand instruction surfaces while
  preserving the three-file startup contract.
- Verified with repo-local skill validation for `codex-tui` and `harness`,
  `cargo run --locked --bin runhaven-check-pins --quiet`,
  `python3 -m json.tool feature_list.json >/dev/null`, local Markdown link
  check over touched docs, and `git diff --check`.

Latest TUI status-bridge reduction:

- 2026-06-29: Removed the inline root `status` bridge from
  `crates/runhaven-tui/src/tui/mod.rs` without activating the full Codex
  `status/` module. Active footer and hook-browser call sites now use
  `tui/runhaven/status_format.rs` for the two helper functions they need.
  `token_usage.rs` is active from real source, and a drift guard keeps full
  `status/` dormant until its config, model-provider, remote-app-server, and
  status-card closure is intentionally promoted.
- `AppEvent::StatusLineGitSummaryUpdated` now uses
  `branch_summary::StatusLineGitSummary` directly, so `app_event_shared.rs`
  no longer re-exports that type through the `chatwidget` bridge.
- Full `status/`, native `App`, `ChatWidget`, real `app_server_session`,
  app-server transport, filesystem RPC, MCP, login, workspace command
  execution, and other host-reaching Codex paths remain dormant or
  fail-closed.
- Verified so far:

Latest TUI session-log source promotion:

- 2026-06-29: Promoted the real vendored Codex `session_log.rs` source and
  removed the no-op `session_log` bridge from `app_event_shared.rs`. This is a
  ChatWidget/AppEvent support surface only; a source-tree guard allows
  `session_log::maybe_init` and `CODEX_TUI_RECORD_SESSION` only in
  `session_log.rs` itself and the parked dormant vendored `tui/lib.rs`
  launcher, not the active temporary `app_shell` path or RunHaven adapters.
- Reduced `codex-core` now exposes `Config::model_provider_id` with the
  default `openai` id, derives known built-in ids from `model_provider`
  overrides, resolves built-in id-only overrides to their matching provider,
  rejects unknown id-only overrides, and preserves explicit custom provider ids
  only when a provider override is supplied. This keeps the upstream session-log
  source compiling without adding full Codex core, app-server transport, login,
  MCP, filesystem, hooks, tools, rollout, state, or thread-store behavior.
- Full `status/`, native `App`, `ChatWidget`, real `app_server_session`,
  app-server transport, filesystem RPC, MCP, login, workspace command
  execution, and other host-reaching Codex paths remain dormant or
  fail-closed. Codex session recording initialization is not active; before any
  native `App` startup promotes it, RunHaven needs a reviewed env/path and
  redaction policy.
- Verified so far:

Latest TUI MVP workspace picker:

- 2026-06-29: Added the missing MVP workspace picker as Step 1 inside the
  existing BottomPane-owned `LaunchWizardView`, without adding product screens
  to `app_shell.rs`. `RunHavenTuiService` now offers the current directory plus
  the git repository root when the selected directory is nested inside a repo.
  Selecting the git root rebuilds the agent preview list for that workspace
  before review, so the mounted `/workspace` path and exact command match the
  chosen workspace.
- Security boundary is unchanged: the picker only changes the validated
  workspace path sent to the existing planner. It does not mount host home,
  credentials, SSH keys, browser profiles, cloud credential folders, arbitrary
  host environment variables, or activate launch execution. Foreground launch
  remains disabled after confirmation.
- Verified so far:
  red compile failures for missing workspace-choice API and wizard path,
  `cargo test -p runhaven-tui --locked launch_workspace_choices_offer_current_and_git_root_for_nested_repo -- --show-output`,

  `cargo run --locked --bin runhaven-check-pins --quiet`,
  `scripts/compare-codex-tui.sh`, JSON validation, snap-new scan, and
  `git diff --check`.

Latest TUI foreground launch handoff:

- 2026-06-29: Confirmation now carries a typed RunHaven `PreparedLaunch`:
  display-only `LaunchPlanData` plus the original executable `AgentRunPlan`.
  `LaunchWizardView` emits `AppEvent::RunHavenLaunchPrepared` with that value,
  and the staging shell exits the draw loop with `ShellExit::Launch` instead of
  starting work from the widget.
- `runhaven/launch_handoff.rs` is the only active TUI file allowed to call
  `runhaven_core::runtime::launch::launch_run_plan`. It clears TUI-owned title
  and terminal image state, clears the TUI screen before handoff, calls Codex
  `Tui::with_restored(RestoreMode::Full, ...)`, and then launches from the
  stored `AgentRunPlan`. It does not reconstruct execution from
  `LaunchPlanData.command`.
- Security boundary is unchanged for Codex host-reaching surfaces:
  app-server transport, filesystem RPC, MCP, login, workspace command
  execution, and Codex session recording remain dormant or fail-closed. The
  full RunHaven launch intent remains excluded from Codex session logging until
  RunHaven owns a redaction policy.
- Verified so far:
  baseline `cargo test -p runhaven-tui --locked`,
  red compile failures for the missing handoff owner, missing
  `ShellAction::Launch`, and display-only `LaunchPlanData` still being
  stored in shell state,
  `cargo test -p runhaven-tui --locked shell_confirm_enter_requests_foreground_launch_handoff -- --show-output`,
  `cargo test -p runhaven-tui --locked secure_plan_confirm_enter_prepares_foreground_launch_handoff -- --show-output`,

  exclusion, and `PreparedLaunch` display/executable consistency.

  `git diff --check`.

Latest TUI active-run log snapshot seam:

- 2026-06-29: Added the first active-run transcript/log backing route without
  adding product UI to `app_shell.rs`. `runhaven/run/logSnapshot` now flows
  through the local RunHaven protocol, in-process client, service, and session
  bridge into `runhaven_core::runtime::active::active_run_log_snapshot_payload`.
  The shared UI contract exposes `ActiveRunLogSnapshotData` as camelCase display
  data converted from the existing core snake_case payload.
- Guard posture: only `runhaven/service.rs` may call the active-run log snapshot
  runtime API, raw-output requests require explicit confirmation before
  validation or backend lookup, malformed line counts fail validation before
  active-run or container log lookup, and `app_shell.rs` must not grow active-run
  log product behavior. This does not activate native `App`, `ChatWidget`,
  app-server transport, filesystem RPC, MCP, login, workspace command execution,
  Codex session recording, or host-reaching Codex execution. Future visible log
  UI must add a redaction and session-recording policy before it renders,
  caches, or logs raw container output.
- Verified:

Latest RunHaven-only TUI MVP surface:

- 2026-06-29: Added the RunHaven-owned MVP root view in
  `crates/runhaven-tui/src/tui/runhaven/mvp.rs` and made the staging shell host
  that view inside the real vendored `BottomPane`. The active TUI now covers
  the scoped MVP path: workspace picker, agent picker, policy changes for
  network mode and auth scope, plan review, typed launch confirmation,
  foreground launch handoff, post-run recovery back into the TUI, active-run
  list, confirmation-gated raw log snapshot display, and secret-free diagnostics
  for auth broker status/log plus provider egress decisions.
- 2026-06-29: Simplified the initial agent chooser for non-technical users.
  The chooser now shows plain guidance, status-first agent rows, workspace,
  current network posture, and the short `/workspace only` safety summary. It
  no longer renders catalog-style agent descriptions, the side `Plan Preview`,
  exact `container run` command, provider-host list, or broker/image/auth
  detail on the first screen. Review and confirm still show auth scope, network
  posture, not-shared host data, provider hosts, safety notes, and the exact
  command before launch.
- 2026-06-29: Removed the active `RUNHAVEN_TUI_IMAGE_SMOKE` hook from the live
  `app_shell.rs` path so terminal hardening stays free of Cubby/pet polish
  scope. The bundled Cubby package and lower pet/image modules remain parked
  for future explicit scope. Source scan confirms no active image-smoke symbols
  remain in `app_shell.rs` or the RunHaven TUI view modules.
- Shared UI contracts now include `ActiveRunListData` and
  `RunHavenDiagnosticsData`. Active-run summaries intentionally omit workspace
  paths, diagnostics map only metadata fields, auth broker request paths are
  scrubbed of query strings and fragments at producer, reader, and UI-contract
  boundaries, and raw container output remains hidden until the user types
  `logs`. Raw log text is kept in live view state only; the active path still
  does not initialize Codex session recording. Post-run recovery preserves the
  effective launch workspace and selected policy, and TUI diagnostics use
  bounded tail reads for log files.
- Guard posture: direct container log backend access still belongs only to
  `runhaven/service.rs`; visible raw-log rendering is guarded to
  `runhaven/mvp.rs`; `app_shell.rs` only owns terminal runtime, foreground
  launch handoff/recovery routing, and process exit-code tracking. Native
  `App`, `ChatWidget`, full `status/`, real app-server transport, filesystem
  RPC, MCP, login, workspace command execution, Codex session recording
  initialization, and host-reaching Codex execution remain dormant or
  fail-closed.

  `git diff --check`; local Rust/Codex/adversarial review of this cleanup found
  no blocker.

Latest TUI onboarding shim hardening:

- 2026-06-29: Added a focused drift/security guard for the remaining inline
  `onboarding` shim in `crates/runhaven-tui/src/tui/mod.rs`. The shim is
  allowed only to expose the hyperlink helper required by active vendored
  widgets, while the full onboarding module stays dormant until RunHaven owns a
  reviewed login/browser/app-server/environment boundary. The guard checks the
  exact inline shim body and verifies risky markers still exist somewhere under
  `onboarding/`, so future source movement forces the boundary decision to be
  revisited instead of silently activating login behavior.
- Updated `crates/runhaven-tui/src/tui/README.md` to match the current vendor
  audit: 372 RunHaven TUI files, 16 RunHaven-only files, 356 common paths, 538
  upstream snapshot goldens not vendored, and 53 copied Codex files with local
  edits.
- Security boundary is unchanged: native `App`, `ChatWidget`, full onboarding,
  app-server transport, filesystem RPC, MCP, login, workspace command
  execution, Codex session recording, and host-reaching Codex execution remain
  dormant or fail-closed.
- Verified: baseline and final `cargo test -p runhaven-tui --locked`, focused
  onboarding-shim guard test, focused `drift_tests`, `cargo fmt --check`,
  `cargo check -p runhaven-tui --locked`, codex-vendored-tests no-run build,
  `cargo clippy -p runhaven-tui --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings`,
  `cargo run --locked --bin runhaven-check-pins --quiet`,
  `scripts/compare-codex-tui.sh`, JSON validation, snap-new scan, em dash scan
  for changed docs/state, Rust/security/adversarial re-review after the stricter
  guard patch, and
  `git diff --check`.

Latest TUI MVP shell ownership guard:

- 2026-06-29: Recorded the current MVP ownership decision in
  `crates/runhaven-tui/src/tui/README.md`: `runhaven/mvp.rs` remains the active
  RunHaven product shell hosted by temporary `app_shell.rs` inside Codex `Tui`
  and the real vendored `BottomPane`. Native Codex `App` and `ChatWidget` stay
  dormant for the scoped RunHaven MVP because the current product flow is
  launch, recovery, active-run logs, and diagnostics, not Codex chat product
  parity.
- Added a drift guard that blocks declaring native `app` or `chatwidget` in
  `tui/mod.rs`, including `#[path = "app.rs"]` or
  `#[path = "chatwidget.rs"]` aliases, while `app_shell.rs` hosts the MVP shell.
  The guard requires only inert `app_event_shared` bridge exports for those
  names, verifies the shell installs `RunHavenMvpView` into the real
  `BottomPane`, and checks that `app_shell.rs` does not activate native `App` or
  `ChatWidget` markers. A focused regression keeps the path-alias detector from
  missing legal Rust blank/comment lines between `#[path = "..."]` and the next
  module item. Native `App` and `ChatWidget` are separate future promotion
  decisions: native `App` requires a RunHaven app-loop need, and `ChatWidget`
  requires a RunHaven conversation-transcript need. Either promotion must first
  replace the temporary shell path it supersedes and add a reviewed redaction,
  session-recording, and app-server boundary.
- Updated the repo-local `codex-tui` skill and Strategy C plan docs so they no
  longer conflict with the MVP-first direction. The current path is Codex `Tui`
  plus real `BottomPane` hosting RunHaven-owned views; native `App` and
  `ChatWidget` are dormant optional promotions, not default MVP parity work.
- Security boundary is unchanged: app-server transport, filesystem RPC, MCP,
  login, workspace command execution, Codex session recording, full onboarding,
  native `App`, `ChatWidget`, and host-reaching Codex execution remain dormant
  or fail-closed.
- Verified: baseline `cargo test -p runhaven-tui --locked`, expected red
  failure for the native App/ChatWidget ownership guard before the README
  decision was recorded, focused green ownership guard test, focused
  `drift_tests` (17 tests), helper bypass regression, `cargo fmt --check`,
  `cargo check -p runhaven-tui --locked`, final
  `cargo test -p runhaven-tui --locked` (784 passed, 5 ignored),
  codex-vendored-tests no-run build, clippy with warnings denied, pin policy,
  `scripts/compare-codex-tui.sh`, JSON validation, stale-direction scan,
  snap-new scan, em dash scan for changed docs/state, Rust/Codex/security/
  adversarial re-review after patching reviewer findings, and
  `git diff --check`.

Latest TUI MVP snapshot matrix:

- 2026-06-29: Added the authoritative RunHaven-owned MVP snapshot matrix under
  `crates/runhaven-tui/src/tui/snapshots/`, with a test-only
  `runhaven/mvp_snapshots.rs` module. The initial matrix covered the agent
  picker, plan review, confirm launch, typed confirm-required launch,
  active-run list, raw-log confirmation, loaded bounded log snapshot,
  secret-free diagnostics, and post-run recovery at both `80x24` and `120x48`.
- 2026-06-29: Expanded the matrix to include the workspace picker with both the
  current-directory option and git-repository-root option selected. The fixture
  mirrors the live service labels and descriptions, uses neutral synthetic
  placeholder paths, and keeps `/workspace only`, host-home exclusion, and
  credentials-not-mounted-by-default safety facts visible in both narrow and
  wide split layouts.
- The snapshots use deterministic fixture data, do not touch external temp or
  workspace state, and do not depend on host environment passthrough. Snapshot
  verification uses repo-local `.snap` goldens. Upstream Codex `.snap` goldens
  remain external; these are RunHaven behavior goldens only.
- 2026-06-30: Expanded the matrix to include confirmation-gated run diff
  review and loaded bounded diff preview at both `80x24` and `120x48`.
- Security boundary is unchanged: app-server transport, filesystem RPC, MCP,
  login, workspace command execution, Codex session recording, full onboarding,
  native `App`, `ChatWidget`, and host-reaching Codex execution remain dormant
  or fail-closed.
- Verification started with the expected red missing-snapshot failure, then
  generated and reran the matrix successfully, including an env-unset rerun.
  Final slice verification is recorded in `feature_list.json`.

Latest TUI MVP module cleanup:

- 2026-06-29: Moved the RunHaven MVP unit tests from inline
  `runhaven/mvp.rs` into sibling `runhaven/mvp_tests.rs`, leaving `mvp.rs`
  focused on runtime state handling and rendering while keeping the snapshot
  matrix in `runhaven/mvp_snapshots.rs`.
- Behavior and security boundary are unchanged: the same tests still cover
  policy key rebuilds, active-run path omission, raw-log confirmation,
  diagnostics redaction, post-run recovery, and the MVP snapshot matrix.
- Verification for the split started with the existing MVP test baseline and
  focused `cargo test -p runhaven-tui --locked runhaven::mvp -- --show-output`.
  Final slice verification is recorded in `feature_list.json`.
- 2026-06-30: Moved the launch wizard unit tests from inline
  `runhaven/launch_wizard.rs` into sibling `runhaven/launch_wizard_tests.rs`,
  reducing the active launch wizard module while preserving the same
  BottomPane, workspace picker, review, typed confirmation, and foreground
  handoff coverage.
- Behavior and security boundary are unchanged: no launch flow, `app_shell.rs`,
  native `App`, `ChatWidget`, app-server transport, filesystem RPC, MCP, login,
  workspace command execution, session recording, or host-reaching Codex path
  changed. Final slice verification is recorded in `feature_list.json`.
- 2026-06-30: Batched the remaining inline RunHaven TUI unit tests into
  sibling test modules for `app_server_client`, `app_server_session`,
  `launch_handoff`, `protocol`, `service`, `status_format`, and
  `terminal_handoff`. The production modules now keep runtime/service/handoff
  code plus `#[cfg(test)]` path hooks, while existing test names and coverage
  stay under their original parent modules.
- Behavior and security boundary are unchanged: the move does not change
  launch, logs, diagnostics, service routing, `app_shell.rs`, native `App`,
  `ChatWidget`, app-server transport, filesystem RPC, MCP, login, workspace
  command execution, session recording, or host-reaching Codex paths. Final
  slice verification is recorded in `feature_list.json`.
- 2026-06-30: Split the remaining large active TUI shell/view files without
  changing behavior. `app_shell.rs` now keeps the Codex runtime host and
  `BottomPane` wiring while shell tests live in `app_shell_tests.rs`.
  `runhaven/mvp.rs` now keeps MVP state/input and delegates panel rendering to
  `runhaven/mvp_render.rs`. `runhaven/launch_wizard.rs` now keeps the wizard
  state machine, delegates workspace/agent picker params and headers to
  `runhaven/launch_wizard_picker.rs`, and delegates review/confirmation
  rendering to `runhaven/launch_wizard_render.rs`. Current active file sizes
  are: `app_shell.rs` 469 lines, `runhaven/mvp.rs` 654 lines,
  `runhaven/launch_wizard.rs` 702 lines,
  `runhaven/launch_wizard_picker.rs` 393 lines, and
  `runhaven/launch_wizard_render.rs` 491 lines.
- Behavior and security boundary are unchanged: this split does not change
  launch, logs, diagnostics, service routing, native `App`, `ChatWidget`,
  app-server transport, filesystem RPC, MCP, login, workspace command
  execution, session recording, or host-reaching Codex paths. Final slice
  verification is recorded in `feature_list.json`.
- 2026-06-30: Updated public TUI documentation to match the current active
  MVP instead of the older disabled-launch status. README and Usage now describe
  workspace choice, agent choice, policy changes, plan review, typed
  confirmation, foreground launch handoff, active-run summaries,
  typed run control, confirmation-gated log snapshots, confirmation-gated run
  diff review, diagnostics, and post-run recovery. Worktree review, cleanup,
  Cubby/pet polish, terminal image polish, and Zork remain out of this
  hardening path.
- 2026-06-30: Final scoped TUI MVP checkpoint audit verified the current
  baseline after review found stale repo-state/docs wording and a missing
  shell-loop launch recovery proof. This did not close the `terminal-ui` feature
  because the product direction now favors CLI plus native GUI instead of
  terminal polish as the product finish line. Local evidence covers the
  checkpoint matrix:
  bare interactive TUI launch and quit, non-TTY CLI help fallback, workspace
  and agent choice, policy changes, plan review, typed confirmation, foreground
  terminal handoff, active-run summaries, typed-confirm raw log snapshots,
  diagnostics, post-run recovery, public docs, vendor audit counts, and
  dormant/fail-closed Codex host-reaching surfaces. The focused app-shell
  recovery test drives the real confirmation action, passes the exact
  executable `AgentRunPlan` into the launcher seam, and renders post-run
  recovery with the returned exit code without requiring Apple `container` or
  credentials.

Latest TUI run history surface:

- 2026-06-30: Promoted the existing `runhaven-core` run records into the
  RunHaven-only TUI without expanding `app_shell.rs`. Shared UI contracts now
  expose newest-first `RunHistoryListData`, with run id, status, policy counts,
  git summary, review command, and worktree branch details. Stored host
  workspace paths and terminal control bytes stay out of the TUI payload.
- The BottomPane-hosted RunHaven view reads recent run history through the
  local RunHaven TUI service using a bounded tail read. Press `h` to open
  recent run history. Snapshot coverage includes `80x24` and `120x48`.
- Security boundary is unchanged: native `App`, `ChatWidget`, app-server
  transport, filesystem RPC, MCP, login, workspace command execution, Codex
  session recording, and host-reaching Codex execution remain dormant or
  fail-closed. Verification covered the red/green history ordering contract,
  focused TUI history tests, snapshot matrix, full `runhaven-tui` tests,
  `codex-vendored-tests` no-run, clippy for `runhaven-core` and
  `runhaven-tui`, pin policy, Codex TUI compare, JSON validation, snap-new
  scan, and diff check.

Latest TUI run diff surface:

- 2026-06-30: Promoted confirmation-gated run diff review into the
  RunHaven-only TUI without expanding `app_shell.rs`. Shared UI contracts now
  expose `RunDiffData`, built from the existing `runhaven-core`
  `run_diff_text` path and bounded before rendering.
- Press Enter on a history record to open run review. The TUI requires typing
  `diff` before backend lookup, rejects paste, keeps the CLI review command as
  fallback text, and warns that diffs can show workspace file contents.
- Security boundary is unchanged: only `runhaven/service.rs` may call
  `run_diff_text`; `runhaven/protocol.rs` and `runhaven/app_server_session.rs`
  expose only the reviewed `runhaven/run/diff` method; `app_shell.rs`, native
  `App`, `ChatWidget`, app-server transport, filesystem RPC, MCP, login,
  workspace command execution, Codex session recording, and host-reaching
  Codex execution remain dormant or fail-closed.

Latest TUI preflight diagnostics surface:

- 2026-06-30: Promoted shared `runhaven-core` doctor checks into the
  RunHaven-only TUI diagnostics screen without expanding `app_shell.rs`. The
  TUI service now combines preflight checks, auth status, provider egress
  metadata, and auth broker metadata in `RunHavenDiagnosticsData`.
- The diagnostics view shows concise `ok` or `fix` preflight rows and inline
  remedies before auth/network metadata. Terminal control bytes are stripped
  from doctor-derived UI fields, successful `container` binary checks do not
  expose host install paths, broker request paths remain scrubbed, and log reads
  stay bounded.
- Security boundary is unchanged: native `App`, `ChatWidget`, app-server
  transport, filesystem RPC, MCP, login, workspace command execution, Codex
  session recording, and host-reaching Codex execution remain dormant or
  fail-closed. Verification covered focused diagnostics contracts, the
  diagnostics snapshot matrix, full `runhaven-core` and `runhaven-tui` tests,
  `codex-vendored-tests` no-run, clippy for `runhaven-core` and
  `runhaven-tui`, pin policy, Codex TUI compare, JSON validation, snap-new
  scan, and diff check.

## Latest TUI Slice

- 2026-06-30: Promoted TUI run-control from a gap into a guarded RunHaven
  surface. Active Runs now opens separate Stop, Hard stop, and Repair marker
  screens; each requires typing `stop`, `kill`, or `repair` before the service
  calls the shared `runhaven-core` stop/kill/repair function. Run-control
  results use `RunControlResultData`, the app-server facade has explicit
  RunHaven methods for those three actions, snapshots cover confirmation and
  result states, and a drift guard keeps direct run-control calls inside
  `runhaven/service.rs` instead of `app_shell.rs` or dormant Codex surfaces.
  Verified with focused run-control tests, the full `runhaven-core` and
  `runhaven-tui` suites, `codex-vendored-tests` no-run, clippy for
  `runhaven-core` and `runhaven-tui`, pin policy, Codex TUI compare, JSON
  validation, snap-new scan, and diff check.
- 2026-06-30: Promoted TUI run-diff review from CLI-only fallback text into a
  guarded RunHaven surface. History Enter opens a Run review screen, typing
  `diff` gates backend lookup, paste is ignored, loaded output is bounded and
  warning-labeled, and the CLI review command remains visible as fallback.
  `RunDiffData` is the shared UI contract; `runhaven/service.rs` is the only
  TUI owner allowed to call `run_diff_text`; and drift guards keep
  `app_shell.rs` plus dormant Codex host-reaching surfaces out of the path.
  Final verification for this slice is recorded in `feature_list.json`.

Latest CLI surface pass:

- 2026-06-30: Re-ran `scripts/cli_surface_check.sh` on macOS 27.0 build
  26A5368g with Apple `container` 1.0.0 commit ee848e3. The breadth check
  passed 39/39 command-family surfaces, including plan/run, worktree diff,
  keep/recover/merge/discard, active run status/attach/kill/repair, state and
  network cleanup confirmation gates, auth/egress logs, and safety `why`
  commands. `docs/CLI_SURFACE_COVERAGE.md` now records this current evidence.

## Blockers

- SSH forwarding remains fail-closed as described above.

## Next Step

Commit and push this TUI hardening plus CLI-audit branch, then merge the
branch/PR. After merge, shift focus to a native-feeling macOS GUI as the easy
path for nontechnical users. Before designing that GUI, research the existing
GitHub-hosted Apple `container` GUI work and decide whether RunHaven should
build, adapt, or avoid it. Do not cut a release, tag, or version bump unless
the maintainer explicitly asks for a release pass.
