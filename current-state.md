# Current State

Last Updated: 2026-06-16 UTC

## Current Objective

Continue Tauri/UI implementation after the first mutating launch slice. The
desktop shell now has setup, dashboard, profile, folder-pick, run-plan review,
and explicitly confirmed launch surfaces. The next implementation should add
one missing launch-readiness or run-control operation at a time only after typed
Rust validation, explicit confirmation, narrow capability review, and focused
tests are in place.

## State Contract

- `feature_list.json`: machine-readable feature state and durable product
  evidence.
- `docs/harness/evidence/evidence-log.md`: meaningful verification, source
  review, packaging, or harness evidence.
- `current-state.md`: current objective, trusted verification, touched
  surfaces, blockers, and next step.
- Do not recreate separate root `progress.md` or `session-handoff.md` files.

## Product State

- RunHaven is a Rust 1.96.0 CLI for running AI coding agents inside Apple
  `container` on macOS 26+ on Apple silicon.
- The application code is organized as a Cargo crate under `src/runhaven/` with
  CLI, runtime, provider, image, records, harness, and support modules. Bundled
  image templates live under top-level `images/`.
- An alpha desktop scaffold lives under `ui/` and `src-tauri/`. It uses
  Svelte + Vite + TypeScript and Tauri v2, calls the root Rust library through
  typed commands, and currently exposes setup/dashboard/profile, native folder
  picking, run-plan review, and an explicitly confirmed launch path.
- The old Python package, Python tests, Python scripts, `pyproject.toml`,
  `.python-version`, and `requirements-dev.txt` have been removed.
- Windows and Linux are not supported runtime or contributor-verification
  targets.
- GitHub Actions CI is disabled during alpha/pre-release to avoid hosted-runner
  cost. Local verification remains authoritative until a maintainer explicitly
  re-enables CI.
- Default product safety boundaries remain: no host home mount, no cloud
  credential folder mount, no raw SSH key mount, no arbitrary environment
  passthrough, explicit workspace scope, non-root bundled images, and
  provider egress allowlisting only through reviewed provider mode.
- HarnessForge output is advisory unless a maintainer promotes a recommendation
  into repo-owned docs, tests, policy, code, or packaging checks.

## Latest Verified Work

- Added `docs/NON_UI_BACKLOG.md` as the consolidated backlog for all remaining
  non-UI gates, accepted polish, candidates, and deferred end-stage packaging
  work.
- Added `docs/TAURI_UI_RESEARCH_PLAN.md` as the active research plan for Tauri
  architecture, frontend framework selection, comparable product analysis, UX
  questions, information architecture, command contracts, and scaffold gates.
- Promoted and then validated Tauri/UI research and framework selection in the
  active harness roadmap.
- Completed the Tauri/UI research phase. The accepted direction is Tauri v2
  with Svelte + Vite + TypeScript, npm lockfile, a separate `src-tauri` crate
  calling the existing Rust library, narrow capabilities, typed command
  contracts, a read-only first scaffold, and no generic shell/filesystem/process
  bridge.
- Added the first Tauri/Svelte scaffold under `ui/` and `src-tauri/` with
  exact-pinned dependencies, checked-in npm and Cargo lockfiles, typed
  read-only Rust commands, and narrow `main-read` plus `folder-pick`
  capabilities.
- Added a Svelte operational UI for setup checks, active/recent run counts,
  agent selection, folder selection, secure-default network choices, resource
  inputs, read-only workspace selection, plan review, and explicit launch
  confirmation.
- Added the first mutating desktop slice: typed Tauri `launch_run`, separate
  `launch-run` capability, shared Rust runtime launch module, shared
  state-volume lock module, frontend launch helper, confirmation controls, and
  Playwright preview coverage. Launch requires plan confirmation, every warning
  acknowledgement, and passing setup checks before it starts a background run.
- Added the next launch-readiness slice: structured image and builder status
  from the existing image doctor path, typed Tauri `get_image_status`,
  `main-read` permission for that command, launch-panel readiness UI, and
  launch refusal when the selected bundled profile image is missing or stale.
- Added launch resource warnings and post-launch snapshot feedback. Tauri
  planning now warns when other RunHaven runs are active and when the selected
  memory limit plus active runs may be material on the host; launch
  confirmation rechecks those dynamic warning codes before start. The UI shows
  a sanitized run snapshot after launch and still keeps raw logs out of
  frontend state.
- Added typed live run-status feedback for the Tauri app. `get_run_status`
  reuses the existing sanitized active-run status payload and returns marker
  status, container state, resources, image, and network metadata without raw
  logs, raw Apple inspect payloads, command arguments, environment, or mounts.
- Remaining launch-readiness gaps before the UI launch flow is complete are
  raw log feedback and dedicated run controls. Stop, kill, attach, repair,
  image build, state cleanup, network cleanup, and worktree review remain
  CLI-first.
- Fixed the Svelte 5 blank-page runtime failure by replacing the old
  `new App(...)` entrypoint with `mount(App, ...)`.
- Added exact-pinned Playwright browser coverage for the UI shell so runtime
  errors, console errors, and blank-page regressions are caught by
  `npm --prefix ui run test:e2e`.
- Updated the local harness so `./init.sh` now runs frontend npm ci, Svelte
  typecheck, Vitest, Playwright, Vite build, Tauri Rust fmt/test/clippy, and
  debug no-bundle Tauri build in addition to the root Rust checks.
- Added the project-wide secure-easy-path rule: the default and shortest path
  should be secure; supported advanced choices warn and require confirmation
  but are not hidden or blocked only because they are advanced.
- Added non-mutating CLI explainers for `runhaven why workspace PATH`,
  `runhaven why network MODE`, and `runhaven why state AGENT`; existing
  `why host` remains the provider-host explainer.
- Added focused integration tests and usage docs for the expanded `why`
  commands.
- Added task recipes for read-only review, local-only checks, provider-only
  runs, worktree review, and exact state reset.
- Added `docs/EXTENSION_MCP_BOUNDARY.md` and linked it from the security model
  so future extension or MCP work has a deny-by-default policy before
  implementation.
- Added a `runhaven-check-pins` sensor that enforces top-of-file descriptions
  for maintained shell scripts and bundled image templates.
- Updated the active harness roadmap and source-mined UX notes so completed
  CLI explainers, script-header enforcement, and extension/MCP policy do not
  keep resurfacing as current backlog.
- Rebuilt the CLI in Rust with exact-pinned Cargo dependencies and a checked-in
  `Cargo.lock`.
- Replaced the Python pin checker with `runhaven-check-pins`.
- Updated `init.sh`, root docs, installation docs, usage docs, pinning docs,
  harness docs, component inventory, verification matrix, manifest metadata,
  and former CI routing for the Rust stack.
- Kept file organization nested by responsibility instead of flattening the
  Rust source tree.
- Split large Rust modules so every Rust source file is under 500 lines; the
  current largest file is `src/runhaven/provider/auth_broker.rs` at 499 lines.
- Updated `.gitignore` for Rust build, coverage, profiling, local
  RunHaven/container, macOS, editor, and pre-Rust Python tooling artifacts.
- Completed the final active-document accuracy sweep for the Rust conversion
  across product docs, GitHub instructions, harness boundaries, roadmap,
  packaging controls, and source-mined ideas.
- Removed ignored local cleanup artifacts from the working tree, including
  stale Python cache/build output and `.DS_Store` files.
- Deduped the main README after the overview refresh so the top-level page now
  keeps one compact product/value narrative, one quick-start path, and routes
  detailed feature and command coverage to `docs/CAPABILITIES.md` and
  `docs/USAGE.md`.
- Reworked `docs/CAPABILITIES.md` into a scan-friendly overview with compact
  tables for runtime defaults, profiles, network modes, credentials,
  sessions/state, observability, and current limits.
- Corrected the Cargo development command in installation docs to name the
  `runhaven` binary explicitly.
- Removed the active GitHub Actions workflow and updated pin-policy and harness
  guidance so no hosted CI jobs run during alpha/pre-release.
- Started the Apple Container pre-Tauri coverage review and added
  `docs/APPLE_CONTAINER_GAP_ANALYSIS.md` as the action ledger for remaining
  runtime, security, and verification gaps.
- Added `scripts/apple_container_smoke.sh` as an opt-in local Apple
  `container` smoke harness. The default path covers `doctor`, shell image
  readiness, internal read-only workspace behavior, active-run
  status/logs-follow/stop cleanup, provider planning, and exact cleanup.
  `--with-provider` adds live provider allowlist and egress-denial coverage.
  `--with-ssh` is a no-secret live SSH-forwarding connectivity check with a
  disposable empty `ssh-agent`; it currently exposes an Apple `container` 1.0.0
  non-root socket permission blocker.
- Fixed the Rust provider CONNECT proxy relay after the live smoke exposed TLS
  tunnel failures. Accepted/tunnel sockets are forced back to blocking mode,
  and CONNECT header reads no longer consume tunneled bytes.
- Added fixture-backed parser tests for Apple `container` JSON shapes covering
  image list, network inspect, container inspect, source-backed legacy
  attachment aliases, invalid shapes, and missing-container repair stderr.
- Tightened parser behavior found during the fixture pass: image matching now
  trusts only actual image-name fields instead of all descriptor annotations,
  and active-run repair no longer removes markers for unrelated `not found`
  inspect failures.
- Extended `runhaven doctor` with JSON-backed Apple `container` runtime pin
  checks. It now fails closed on mismatched runtime commit, builder image,
  vminit image, or Kata kernel fields from the structured
  `container system version --format json` and
  `container system property list --format json` probes.
- Split the new doctor runtime-pin implementation into
  `src/runhaven/cli/doctor/runtime_pins.rs` so the main doctor module stays
  well under the repo's Rust file-size ceiling.
- Extended `runhaven image doctor` with read-only Apple builder diagnostics
  from `container builder status --format json`. The output reports sanitized
  builder state, image, CPU/memory allocation, Rosetta mode, start time, and
  network address while avoiding builder mounts and environment.
- Updated `scripts/apple_container_smoke.sh` to assert that
  `image doctor shell` reports builder status and large-build resource
  guidance.
- Added `docs/TAURI_UI_GUARDRAILS.md` as the active UI contract for Tauri
  resource warnings, approval gates, typed Rust commands, narrow capabilities,
  and denied-by-default WebView access.
- Added an accepted backlog item to give every maintained script a short
  top-of-file description explaining what it is and what it does.
- Added provider-mode troubleshooting guidance that distinguishes allowlist
  denials from host-side proxy reachability or macOS Local Network privacy
  failures.
- Changed `--ssh` to fail closed in planner and run paths while Apple
  `container` 1.0.0 non-root SSH forwarding is blocked. The flag stays visible
  so users get an explicit refusal instead of an implied working private-Git
  path.
- Updated `scripts/apple_container_smoke.sh` so the default path verifies
  `runhaven plan --ssh` refusal, and `--with-ssh` verifies `runhaven run --ssh`
  refusal before launch.
- Added `docs/harness/release/apple-container-update-playbook.md` for Apple
  `container` runtime, helper image, installer, Kata kernel, CLI help, smoke,
  cleanup, and rollback evidence before future pin changes.
- Added top-of-file descriptions to every maintained shell script and bundled
  image template.
- Ran whole-repo Rust expert review and addressed the findings: auth broker
  upstream requests now use the configured global timeout, standard and provider
  launch failures remove active markers and record failed runs when a run
  started, cleanup failures stay visible in run records, the crate is marked
  `publish = false`, and tests were moved out of near-limit files to preserve
  the source-size ceiling.
- Fixed the provider-mode bind regression exposed by live verification. Apple
  `container` 1.0.0 reports a guest gateway that is not bindable on macOS, so
  RunHaven uses the gateway URL for guests while allowing a wildcard host
  listener only with explicit Apple-container subnet rejection.

  `target/debug/runhaven network list`, pin policy, JSON validation, local
  Markdown link check, active-doc platform/stale-command scan, and
  `git diff --check` passed.
- SSH forwarding smoke review found a blocker: Bash syntax check and the
  default `scripts/apple_container_smoke.sh` path passed, corrected
  `scripts/apple_container_smoke.sh --with-ssh` failed as expected with
  `Error connecting to agent: Permission denied`, and cleanup checks found no
  active runs or RunHaven state volumes. The script now treats that as a failed
  live SSH smoke instead of passing on socket existence.
- SSH fail-closed guard checks passed: `cargo fmt --check`,

  review, JSON validation for `feature_list.json` and
  `docs/harness/manifest.json`, local Markdown link check, stale-text scan,
  `cargo run --locked --bin runhaven-check-pins`, and `git diff --check`.
- Tauri/UI research completion checks passed: Antigravity read-only research,
  current official Tauri/Tauri plugin/Vite/Svelte/React/Solid/Vue/comparable UI
  source review, current npm and Cargo package-version checks, JSON validation,
  local Markdown link check, stale-text scan, `cargo run --locked --bin
  runhaven-check-pins`, and `git diff --check`.

## Blockers

- Apple `container` 1.0.0 exposes an SSH agent socket to the RunHaven non-root
  `agent` user with `--ssh`, but the guest cannot use it: `ssh-add -l` returns
  permission denied. RunHaven now fails closed on `--ssh`; do not re-enable it,
  mount raw SSH keys, or switch the default agent user to root without explicit
  security review and no-secret runtime proof.

## Next Step

Choose the next Tauri/UI slice deliberately. The best next step is raw log
viewing design or the first explicit run-control operation. Raw logs need a
dedicated design because agent output can contain secrets or workspace content.
For mutating controls, add stop, kill, attach, repair, image build, state
cleanup, network cleanup, and worktree review one at a time with typed Rust
