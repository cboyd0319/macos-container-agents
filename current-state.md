# Current State

Last Updated: 2026-06-26 UTC

## Current Objective

The `cli-complete-v0.5.0` scope is complete and verified (`passing` in
`feature_list.json`). RunHaven remains alpha/pre-release until the `v0.5.0` tag is
cut at the release-readiness step.

Next phase (2026-06-26 user directive): all GUI/UI work, both the Tauri desktop
app and the terminal UI (TUI), moves to the very end of the roadmap. Runtime and
security hardening of the Apple `container` boundary leads now, ahead of any new
feature surface. The already-shipped desktop run-control and diagnostics slices
stay `passing`; no GUI work is reverted, only re-sequenced behind the non-UI
hardening, remaining product scope, and release work. The
`runtime-security-hardening` slice is `passing` and was merged to `main`
2026-06-26 (with the four-agent `runhaven login` work, the egress family-pattern
step, the non-technical UX pass, and a full docs and README refresh); no feature
is currently `active`.

## Startup State Contract

- `AGENTS.md`: root instruction map.
- `feature_list.json`: compact feature status and next product slice.
- `current-state.md`: progress, trusted facts, blockers, and handoff.

Do not recreate separate root `progress.md` or `session-handoff.md` files.
Load deeper docs only when the task touches that surface.

## Product Facts

- RunHaven is a Rust 1.96.0 CLI for running AI coding agents inside Apple
  `container` on macOS 26+ on Apple silicon.
- The CLI is the current working product surface.
- The alpha desktop shell lives under `ui/` and `src-tauri/`.
- `v0.5.0` is now the intended CLI-complete release. All CLI product work
  should be done by that tag before broad v1 desktop expansion.
- RunHaven remains alpha/pre-release until after `v0.5.0` is cut.
- All GUI/UI work is deferred to the very end of the roadmap (2026-06-26 user
  directive), superseding the prior `v1.0.0` = first-class-desktop boundary. The
  CLI stays the product surface through the near-term releases; the desktop app
  and TUI are the final roadmap phase. The version label for the desktop release
  is open and not locked to `v1.0.0`.
- The product sequence is CLI-complete (`v0.5.0`), then runtime/security
  hardening of the Apple `container` boundary, then remaining non-UI product
  scope and a CLI-based public release, then (at the very end) the first-class
  desktop app and a terminal UI (TUI) over the same planner and policy objects.
- Above all else, secure defaults must be the easiest path. Supported
  lower-security choices should warn and require explicit intent; unsupported
  or hard-boundary violations still fail closed.
- Apple `container machine` is not the default RunHaven boundary, but explicit
  or user-managed machine workflows should not be blocked solely because they
  are less secure. They should warn, require intent, and fail only for concrete
  unsupported or unsafe states.
- All current and future development is DRY and documentation-first. Walk the
  build-necessity ladder (YAGNI, standard library, native platform,
  already-installed dependency, one clear line, then minimum custom code),
  prefer boring over clever, remove meaningful duplication, and ship docs in the
  same slice as the behavior. Every stage also considers file size, modularity,
  crate/component organization, exact current-stable pins, and harness state.
  `AGENTS.md` Working Rules and `docs/harness/boundaries/change-contract.md`
  hold the canonical gate.
- Windows and Linux are not supported runtime or contributor-verification
  targets.
- GitHub Actions CI is disabled during alpha/pre-release. Local verification is
  authoritative until a maintainer explicitly re-enables CI.
- Default safety boundaries remain: no host home mount, no cloud credential
  folder mount, no raw SSH key mount, no arbitrary environment passthrough,
  explicit workspace scope, non-root bundled images, and provider egress
  allowlisting only through reviewed provider mode.

## Key Decisions

Durable rationale that compaction tends to lose. Change these only with new
evidence and a recorded reason.

- All GUI/UI work (desktop app and TUI) is deferred to the very end of the
  roadmap, and runtime/security hardening leads the near-term work (2026-06-26
  user directive). This reverses the prior sequence where `v1.0.0` was the
  first-class desktop release. Rationale: harden and complete the non-UI product
  and its release before building the heavier desktop/TUI surfaces and the
  signing/notarization path. Already-shipped GUI slices stay `passing`; they are
  re-sequenced, not reverted. Reopen only with a new user directive.
- Default boundary is task-scoped `container run`, not `container machine`,
  because machine workflows map the host user, home, and credentials into the
  guest. Machine use is warned and explicit, not blocked.
- `--ssh` fails closed because Apple `container` 1.0.0 exposed the forwarded
  socket to the non-root guest but `ssh-add -l` returned permission denied;
  enabling it would need a raw key mount or a root default user. Reopen only
  with a no-secret runtime proof.
- CI stays disabled during alpha because local macOS 26 verification is
  authoritative and hosted CI cannot exercise the Apple `container` boundary.
  Re-enable only by explicit maintainer decision.
- The harness is a three-file startup contract because bulk startup context was
  the failure mode; deeper `docs/harness/` material is on-demand reference.
- Exactly one feature is `active` in `feature_list.json` to hold scope; the
  `active` row is the current slice, distinct from `planned` work.
- All development is DRY and documentation-first by standing rule (2026-06-24
  user directive), not a per-slice decision. The build-necessity ladder in
  `AGENTS.md` Working Rules and the `change-contract.md` Build Necessity Gate are
  the single canonical source; documentation-is-product means an undocumented
  behavior is treated as not shipped. Boring-over-clever and the edge-case
  tiebreaker (between equally small standard-library options, take the one
  correct on edge cases) resolve style and algorithm choices.
- The `GitSnapshot`/`GitChange` `available` field is a serde enum tag that
  serializes as the string "true"/"false", never a JSON boolean. Read serialized
  git values with `git_value_available` (or match the typed enum); never
  `Value::as_bool` on `available`. Reading it as a bool silently broke every
  worktree run, diff, and merge until 2026-06-25. The `dirty`, `changed`, and
  `truncated` fields are real booleans.
- The default `--network` mode is profile-aware so the secure path is also the
  default path (2026-06-25 user directive: the secure path must be the easiest
  path, inform rather than block, do not restrict where a restriction cannot be
  made easy). Profiles with bundled provider hosts default to `provider`;
  profiles without them default to `internet` because provider mode would be an
  empty-allowlist dead end. Internet mode is never blocked, only warned. Revisit
  only if a broader safe default becomes both more secure and as usable.
- The `glib` advisory GHSA-wrw7-89jp-8q8g is treated as not-affected because
  `glib` enters only through Tauri's Linux GTK backend and is absent from the
  macOS build graph; it is capped at 0.18.x by `gtk 0.18.2`. Dependabot alert
  was dismissed as "not used" on 2026-06-24. Rationale in `docs/PINNING.md`.
- Provider egress should be low-friction for non-technical users without
  weakening the boundary (2026-06-26 user direction: RunHaven is primarily for
  less-technical people; the user must manage no hosts and see no hostnames). The
  agreed model: trust each agent's own provider expressed as a few stable
  domain-family patterns, not individual hosts; keep default-deny so data-egress
  hosts (`storage.googleapis.com`, etc.) stay closed by simply never being in an
  allow-pattern; degrade gracefully when an optional host is blocked; and
  eventually ship the per-agent policy as signed, auto-updating data so new
  provider endpoints need no release or user action. Step 1 (narrow
  `*-name.domain.tld` family patterns in the egress matcher, anchored to one
  registrable domain) is built and used for Antigravity. Remaining: graceful
  degradation, plain-language foreign-host messaging, and the auto-updating
  policy. This is still an allowlist (default-deny); it just speaks in families.

## Latest Verified Work

- 2026-06-26: CLI command + docs contract audit (a `v0.5.0` closure item, on
  `main`, committed locally). Cross-checked the full command tree (14 top-level
  commands plus all subcommand groups: runs 15, image 3, network 2, state 3,
  auth 3, egress 1, why 4) against the clap help, `CLI_SURFACE_COVERAGE.md`, and
  `USAGE.md`. Fixed one doc gap (`runhaven agents` was missing from USAGE; added
  a List Agents section). The breadth surface check then caught a real regression
  from this session's `--auth-scope agent` default: `runhaven run --session X`
  now uses the shared per-agent volume, so `state reset --session X` (always
  project-scoped) targeted a session volume the run no longer creates and failed
  on a non-existent volume. Fixes: `state reset`/`state prune` deletion is now
  existence-aware (a missing volume is reported, not an error) and retries while
  a volume is transiently held after a stop or kill (Apple container does not
  auto-remove the container); the surface check's active run uses `--auth-scope
  project` so the session-volume reset path is actually exercised. Result:
  `cli_surface_check.sh` 39/39. Verified: cargo fmt, `cargo test --locked` (69
  lib incl. a new `volume_in_list` test + 6 integration), clippy `-D warnings`,
  `git diff --check`. Follow-up: RunHaven runs without `--rm`, so killed
  containers reap asynchronously; a runtime-lifecycle review is a separate item.
- 2026-06-26: Profile support tiers (a `v0.5.0` CLI-complete closure item, on
  `main`, committed locally). Made the per-agent support matrix code-derived so
  it cannot drift: `runhaven agents` now prints sign-in path (`runhaven login`
  vs in-sandbox vs n/a), default network (provider/internet), and API-key broker
  (yes/no) per agent, sourced from `login::supports_login`,
  `default_network_mode`, and `auth_profiles::is_brokered`. Fixed the stale
  `CAPABILITIES.md` matrix (codex now lists `auth.openai.com`; copilot lists the
  `githubcopilot.com` hosts plus `github.com`/`api.github.com`; added the
  `runhaven login` mentions) and pointed it at `runhaven agents`; updated
  `CLI_SURFACE_COVERAGE.md` and marked the `NON_UI_BACKLOG.md` item done. Tests
  assert the login set {claude, codex, copilot, antigravity} and the broker set
  {claude, codex, gemini}. Verified: cargo fmt, `cargo test --locked` (68 lib +
  6 integration), clippy `-D warnings`, doc scans and `git diff --check` clean.
- 2026-06-26: Full repo docs and README refresh, then merged the
  `runtime-security-hardening` branch to `main`. Rewrote `README.md` (added the
  `runhaven login` sign-in story for all four agents, plain-language egress
  framing, and the corrected GUI-and-TUI-last roadmap), and updated the product,
  roadmap, and policy docs to match current state (PROVIDER_ENDPOINTS host sets
  and the domain-family pattern, USAGE/CAPABILITIES/SECURITY_MODEL/ARCHITECTURE
  broker-and-egress wording, ROADMAP/V1_RELEASE_PLAN/NON_UI_BACKLOG re-sequencing
  and login-done, CLI_SURFACE_COVERAGE login row, CONTRIBUTING/SECURITY/RESEARCH).
  Verified: `git diff --check`, em-dash/emoji/canned-phrase scans clean, relative
  Markdown link check (32 README links + the rest, 0 broken), pin check passed,
  and a final `cargo fmt`/`test --locked` (66 lib + 6 integration)/clippy
  `-D warnings` green. Pushed to `origin/main`.
- 2026-06-26: Non-technical UX pass on login/run output (the "much easier"
  thread, after the four-agent set). (1) `launch_run_plan` now preflights the
  agent image (`image_doctor::image_is_built`) and fails with "Build it once
  with: runhaven image build <agent>" instead of the cryptic
  `registry-1.docker.io 401`. (2) Login guidance anticipates the two verified
  friction points: Codex points to ChatGPT Settings then Security for device-code
  login; Copilot pre-warns that the plaintext-keychain prompt should be answered
  `y` because the file lives in the isolated volume. (3) The end-of-run
  blocked-host output is now a calm two-line plain-language notice ("RunHaven
  kept <agent> inside its provider's network and blocked N other destinations to
  protect your data; run `runhaven egress log` ...") instead of a per-host
  technical dump; detail stays in `runhaven egress log`, and the now-dead
  `provider_denial_next_action` was removed. Verified: fmt, `cargo test --locked`
  (66 lib + 6 integration), clippy `-D warnings`, `git diff --check`. Remaining
  UX: the auto-updating signed provider-policy file (post-alpha, the bigger
  lift), and a live look at the new messages on the user's machine.
- 2026-06-26: Added narrow domain-family allowlist patterns (step 1 of the
  lower-friction egress design). The egress matcher now accepts maintainer-
  curated `*-name.domain.tld` wildcard patterns, anchored so the wildcard can
  only expand a subdomain label inside one registrable domain (must start with
  `-` or `.` and carry a >=2-dot tail; `*-foo.com` is rejected at construction).
  Applied to Antigravity: the exact `daily-cloudcode-pa` pin became
  `*-cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com`, so any Google Cloud Code channel/region prefix
  is covered without a re-pin while `storage` and other googleapis.com services
  stay denied. Tests: positive (daily-/us- allowed), negative-exfil (storage
  denied), construction guard (cross-domain rejected). Verified: fmt, `cargo test
  --locked` (65 lib + 6 integration), clippy `-D warnings`, `git diff --check`.
- 2026-06-26: Built and live-verified `runhaven login antigravity`, completing
  the user's four-agent set (Claude, Codex, Copilot, Antigravity). agy has no
  login subcommand, so `runhaven login antigravity` runs agy, whose first run
  triggers a Google OAuth sign-in (the user approves in the host browser, then
  types /exit); the login persists in the shared home volume. Observing the real
  egress corrected the reverse-engineered research: the flow is Google
  auth-code with a redirect to `antigravity.google` (not device-code, not
  localhost), and the live model endpoint is `daily-cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com`
  (not `cloudcode-pa` alone). Pinned 4 bundled hosts from the egress ledger:
  `oauth2.googleapis.com`, `www.googleapis.com`, `cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com`,
  `daily-cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com`. `accounts.google.com` and
  `antigravity.google` are browser-side only, not bundled. Live-verified: the
  model answered prompts ("Kermit is green"). agy's startup eligibility check
  fetches `lh3.googleusercontent.com` (profile pic); blocked it is a cosmetic
  "Eligibility check failed" line and the agent still works, so it is left out of
  the default (least privilege) with a documented `--provider-host` opt-in.
  antigravity now defaults to provider mode (it has bundled hosts), a security
  improvement over the prior internet default. Decision: keep tight host pins,
  not `*.googleapis.com` (that would open `storage.googleapis.com` as an
  exfil channel). Verified: fmt, `cargo test --locked` (63 lib incl. an updated
  default-network test + 6 integration), clippy `-D warnings`, `git diff
  --check`. Open question from the user: geo/endpoint variation of the
  cloudcode-pa hosts; a narrow `*-cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com` matcher (Google
  controls googleapis.com, so it cannot open storage/gmail) is the candidate fix.
- 2026-06-26: Built `runhaven login` for Codex and Copilot (in-sandbox device
  flow). Each runs the CLI's own device-code login (`codex login --device-auth`;
  `copilot login`) once inside the sandbox on the agent's shared home volume
  (`--auth-scope agent`), reusing `launch_run_plan` in provider mode. The
  credential stays in the isolated volume; RunHaven never sees the token.
  Allowlisted the login/refresh hosts in `endpoints.rs`: `auth.openai.com` for
  Codex; `github.com` and `api.github.com` for Copilot (a deliberate, documented
  egress widening, flipped from `candidate` to `bundled` in the endpoint matrix).
  `--clear` deletes that agent's shared home volume. Added
  `paths::login_workspace_dir` (a stable read-only login workspace), command +
  allowlist unit tests, and `AUTH_BROKER`/`USAGE` docs. Verified: cargo fmt,
  `cargo test --locked` (63 lib incl. 2 new login tests + 6 integration), clippy
  `-D warnings`, `git diff --check`. Live-verified 2026-06-26: `runhaven login
  codex` reached `auth.openai.com/codex/device` and returned "Successfully
  logged in"; `runhaven login copilot` reached `github.com/login/device` and
  returned "Signed in successfully", both persisted in the shared home volume.
  Two verified gotchas: Codex needs the ChatGPT account "device code
  authorization" setting on (OpenAI gates it, not RunHaven); Copilot has no
  in-container keychain so it prompts "Store token in plaintext config file?
  (y/N)" defaulting to N, the user must answer y (the token lands in the
  isolated volume, the same model as every other in-container login). Prereqs
  that bit during verification: the agent image must be built first
  (`runhaven image build <agent>`; an unbuilt image fails with a cryptic
  registry-1.docker.io 401), and Apple container DNS had gone stale after a host
  network change (fixed with `container system stop && container system start`).
  The user flagged that these friction points need much friendlier UX/phrasing
  (image-not-built message, Copilot keychain heads-up, Codex toggle heads-up) as
  the next thread. Antigravity login is the last of the four (its hosts are
  reverse-engineered, so observe real egress before pinning an allowlist).
- 2026-06-26: Built `runhaven login claude`, the Claude setup-token opt-in (the
  zero-friction path the user chose; Claude has no in-container device login at
  the pinned version). It runs Anthropic's `claude setup-token` on the host
  (needs host Claude Code), stores the token `0600` in the RunHaven cache, and
  `runhaven run claude` injects it at run time as a name-only
  `--env CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` (value from the RunHaven process env, never on
  the argv or in the printed `plan`). A run-time notice marks the injection;
  provider-mode egress confines the token to Anthropic's hosts;
  `runhaven login claude --clear` removes it. New
  `src/runhaven/runtime/login.rs` + `paths::oauth_token_path`, wired into the
  standard and provider run paths; docs in `AUTH_BROKER`/`USAGE`. Verified: cargo
  fmt, `cargo test --locked` (61 lib incl. 2 new login tests + 6 integration),
  clippy `-D warnings`, Tauri builds and clippy. Live-verified 2026-06-26:
  `runhaven login claude` stored the token and `runhaven run claude` came up
  authenticated with no login prompt (zero friction).
- 2026-06-26: Started the `oauth-isolated-login` slice (easy OAuth; the product's
  target audience uses subscription/OAuth logins, not API keys). Live-verified
  that a Claude Max subscription OAuth login works end to end inside a RunHaven
  sandbox: provider mode with the login hosts (`api.anthropic.com`, `claude.ai`,
  `platform.claude.com`) allowlisted, no host credentials mounted; telemetry and
  registry hosts were correctly blocked and the agent still ran. The OAuth path
  is the isolated in-container login (not a broker; brokering is ToS-forbidden).
  Built the first piece: `--auth-scope <agent|project>` (default `agent`) shares
  one per-agent home volume (`runhaven-<agent>-shared-home`) across all
  workspaces so the login is done once; `project` keeps the per-workspace volume.
  Documented the shared-login tradeoff in `SECURITY_MODEL`/`USAGE`/`CAPABILITIES`.
  Verified: cargo fmt, `cargo test --locked` (59 lib incl. a new auth-scope test
  + 6 integration), clippy `-D warnings`, Tauri test (30) and clippy. One UX
  friction the user flagged: the in-sandbox login requires copy/pasting the URL
  to the browser and the code back; remaining work cuts that (see Next Step).
- 2026-06-26: Completed the `multi-provider-broker` slice (branch
  `runtime-security-hardening`, not yet merged). Generalized the Codex API-key
  broker into a provider-agnostic core (`ProviderBrokerProfile`: upstream host,
  path matcher, credential-injection strategy, guest redirect) and wired Codex,
  Claude, and Gemini brokers into the run orchestration. The real host key stays
  host-side for every provider; the guest gets only a placeholder plus a base-URL
  redirect (Codex custom-provider config; Claude `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` with
  `x-api-key`; Gemini `GOOGLE_GEMINI_BASE_URL` with `x-goog-api-key`). Renamed
  `--codex-api-key-broker-env` to `--api-key-broker-env` (old name kept as an
  alias) and the field/types; flipped Claude/Gemini `auth_profiles` from
  design-only to the api-key-broker status; Copilot stays design-only (token
  exchange + dynamic API host cannot be brokered without TLS interception). OAuth
  and subscription logins stay out of broker scope and use isolated in-container
  state; RunHaven never reads host `~/.claude.json` or the Keychain. Docs updated:
  `AUTH_BROKER.md`, `SECURITY_MODEL.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `CAPABILITIES.md`,
  `USAGE.md`. Verified: cargo fmt, `cargo test --locked` (58 lib incl. 3 new
  broker-config tests + 6 integration), clippy `-D warnings`, Tauri `cargo test`
  (30) and clippy. Claude/Gemini live redirect needs a real provider key on the
  target CLI version (unit and fail-closed tested here). Commits 4f11716,
  b5cf193, 2d696e2 plus docs.
- 2026-06-26: Completed the `runtime-security-hardening` audit-and-fix slice
  (branch `runtime-security-hardening`, not yet merged). Ran a two-lens audit
  (apple-container-expert + security-audit) cross-referenced against the upstream
  Apple source clone; the core boundary verified sound. Empirically confirmed
  audit finding #1 (Medium) with a scoped live probe on macOS 27.0: a hostOnly
  guest opened raw TCP to a host listener on the gateway while direct internet
  egress was refused. Apple `container` 1.0.0 has no per-port guest-to-host
  firewalling, so #1 is remediated by a `SECURITY_MODEL.md` caveat plus guidance,
  with an in-guest eBPF egress filter logged design-first. Fixed under test: #2
  the state-volume-prep root container now drops all caps and re-adds only
  CHOWN/FOWNER/DAC_OVERRIDE (live smoke confirmed prep still works); #4 added
  `/usr`, `/bin`, `/sbin`, `/opt` to `sensitive_workspace_paths`; #5 the provider
  proxy and Codex broker warn on the `0.0.0.0` bind fallback. Also ran a
  competitive landscape scan (clones under `~/Documents/GitHub/`: `sand`,
  `container-use`, `agent-sandbox`) and recorded borrowed ideas in
  `NON_UI_BACKLOG.md`. Verified: cargo fmt, `cargo test --locked` (52 unit incl.
  3 new + 6 integration), clippy `-D warnings`, `git diff --check`, and
  `scripts/apple_container_smoke.sh` on macOS 27.0.
- 2026-06-25: Added desktop diagnostics (partial V1-G5): read-only, secret-free
  `get_egress_log`, `get_auth_log`, and `get_auth_status` behind the `main-read`
  capability. `read_egress_policy_log`/`read_auth_broker_log` back the logs; a new
  shared `auth_status_payload` core backs both the CLI `auth status` and the Tauri
  command. Responses map only metadata (host/port/decision/reason/count,
  method/path/upstream-status) and intentionally omit workspace paths, mirroring
  the CLI text output. A self-contained `DiagnosticsPanel` fetches and renders
  them on demand, keeping `App.svelte` lean. `why` explanations, blocked-host
  review, and auth explain remain CLI-only. Verified: main `cargo test` (49),
  Tauri `cargo test` (30, incl. 3 diagnostics mapper tests + `capability_guard`)/
  clippy, svelte-check, 15 unit tests, build, and Playwright e2e (3, incl. a
  diagnostics load test).
- 2026-06-25: Completed the V1-G3 desktop run-control surface by adding GUI
  `kill_run` and `repair_run`, mirroring `stop_run`. Shared library cores
  `kill_active_run` and `repair_active_run` validate the run id, active marker,
  and RunHaven-owned container before `container kill` / stale-marker repair, and
  back both the CLI `runs_kill`/`runs_repair` and the typed Tauri commands. Both
  require confirmation and sit behind the `run-control` capability
  (`allow-kill-run`, `allow-repair-run`). `RunStatusPanel` now has Hard stop and
  Repair marker controls with per-action confirm checkboxes over consolidated
  `controlBusy`/`controlError`/`controlMessage` state and a shared `runControl`
  helper in `App.svelte` (DRY across stop/kill/repair). Verified: main
  `cargo test` (49), Tauri `cargo test` (27, incl. 4 new kill/repair tests +
  `capability_guard`)/clippy, svelte-check, 15 unit tests, build, and Playwright
  e2e (2, extended to stop+kill+repair a preview run).
- 2026-06-25: Implemented `tauri-stop-run-control`, the first v1 desktop GUI
  feature. Added a shared library core `stop_active_run` that validates the run
  id, active marker, and RunHaven-owned container before `container stop`, and
  backs both the CLI `runs_stop` and the typed Tauri `stop_run` command. The
  command requires `confirm_stop`, lives behind the narrow `run-control`
  capability (`allow-stop-run` added to `build.rs` and `run-control.json`;
  `capability_guard` confirms it is an `allow-*` scope), and `RunStatusPanel`
  shows a confirm checkbox plus a Stop button whose success state is set only
  after the command returns. Verified: main `cargo test` (49), Tauri `cargo test`
  (23, incl. 4 new `stop_run` tests + `capability_guard`)/clippy, svelte-check,
  15 unit tests, build, and Playwright e2e (2, extended to stop a preview run).
- 2026-06-25: Completed the v1 desktop maintainability split (milestone 1 /
  V1-G10) before adding GUI controls. Split `src-tauri/src/commands/mod.rs`
  (528 -> 342) into `validation.rs` (bounds validators) and `warnings.rs` (plan
  warnings); split `ui/src/commands/runhaven.ts` (543) into `types.ts`,
  `client.ts`, and `plan.ts` behind a 6-line barrel so importers are unchanged;
  split `ui/src/app/App.svelte` (569 -> 409) into `SetupChecksPanel`,
  `PlanReviewPanel`, `LastLaunchPanel`, `RunStatusPanel`, and `RunOutputPanel`
  components, keeping the launch form and container state in `App.svelte`.
  Behavior preserved: Tauri tests (19)/clippy, svelte-check (0 errors), 15 unit
  tests, build, and Playwright e2e (2) pass. `tauri-stop-run-control` is now the
  active slice.
- 2026-06-25: Produced documented evidence that every CLI surface is tested.
  Added `scripts/cli_surface_check.sh`, a repeatable live breadth check that
  exercises every command family (agents, doctor, setup, plan, run,
  run --worktree, image build/rebuild/doctor, network list/prune,
  state list/reset/prune, runs list/show/log/diff/keep/recover/merge/discard/
  active/status/attach/kill/repair, egress log, auth status/explain/log, why
  host/workspace/network/state) and self-cleans. It found a real bug: the
  `GitSnapshot`/`GitChange` `available` serde tag serializes as the string
  "true"/"false", but four sites read it with `Value::as_bool` (always None),
  silently breaking `run --worktree`, `runs diff`, and `runs merge` for every
  clean repo. Fixed with a canonical `git_value_available` reader plus typed
  `GitSnapshot` enum matches in the worktree code, with a regression test.
  Coverage is indexed in `docs/CLI_SURFACE_COVERAGE.md`. Final evidence on macOS
  27.0: `cli_surface_check.sh` 39/39, `apple_container_smoke.sh --with-provider
  --with-ssh` passed, and both crates green on fmt/test/clippy plus pins, JSON,
  and diff checks.
- 2026-06-25: Made the network mode secure-by-default per the user directive
  that the secure path must be the easiest path. `--network` is now optional and
  resolves profile-aware in `make_run_plan` via `default_network_mode`: provider
  for profiles with bundled provider hosts (claude, codex, copilot, gemini) and
  internet for those without (shell, antigravity), where provider would be an
  empty allowlist. A provider-default run reaches the agent's own API but not
  arbitrary hosts; `plan` and `run` inform the `--provider-host` / `--network
  internet` escape hatch and never block. Updated CLI plus `CAPABILITIES`,
  `USAGE`, `ARCHITECTURE`, `SECURITY_MODEL`, `README`, `V1_RELEASE_PLAN`, and the
  harness security-boundary map; added a focused `default_network_mode` test.
  Verified with cargo fmt/test (48 unit + 6 integration)/clippy, Tauri test
  (19, 1 ignored)/clippy, and live plan checks (claude defaults to provider,
  shell to internet, explicit `--network internet` override works). This resolves
  the last open v0.5.0 decision, so `cli-complete-v0.5.0` is now `passing`.
- 2026-06-24: Closed the `cli-complete-v0.5.0` contract gaps (G1-G7) in one
  pass. Added plain-language security notices to standard error for every
  lower-security run choice (internet default, `--env`, custom or root `--user`,
  extra `--provider-host`, `--allow-sensitive-workspace`, `--image`), computed
  once in `build_run_plan`, carried on `AgentRunPlan`, and emitted at plan and
  run time; secure defaults stay silent (G6). Documented the previously
  undocumented `--user` and `runs attach` `--user`/`--workdir`/`--tty` overrides
  (G1), published the per-profile support matrix (G3), documented the
  runs/egress/auth JSONL records as best-effort/pre-stable, append-only,
  metadata-only with `--json` as the supported read path (G2), confirmed `--ssh`
  fail-closed posture is consistent across docs, behavior, and tests with no
  raw-key workaround (G5), and kept touched modules under the size guard with no
  new duplication (G7; `auth_broker.rs` 499 and `egress.rs` 495 remain watched,
  untouched). Verified with root cargo fmt/test (47 unit + 6 integration)/clippy,
  Tauri test (19, 1 ignored)/clippy, and a live `plan` security-notice check. One
  product decision is open: whether to flip the warned `internet` default to a
  stricter mode before `v1.0.0`. Tagged release notes are deferred to the
  release-readiness step. Status in `docs/RELEASE_GAP_ANALYSIS.md`.
- 2026-06-24: Proved the Apple `container` runtime on the current host. The
  session host moved to macOS 27.0 (build 26A5368g); prior runtime evidence was
  macOS 26.5.1. Started the Apple `container` system service (it was stopped at
  session start), confirmed `runhaven doctor` is green for every pinned
  prerequisite on macOS 27.0 (Rust 1.96.0, container CLI/apiserver 1.0.0 commit
  ee848e3, builder 0.12.0, vminit 0.33.3, Kata kernel 6.18.15-186), verified the
  bundled shell image (`runhaven/base:0.1.0`, digest `818ed6181723`), and ran
  `scripts/apple_container_smoke.sh --with-provider --with-ssh` to completion.
  The smoke exercised an internal read-only `/workspace` run with the full
  active/status/logs-follow/stop/show lifecycle, the live provider allowlist
  (allowed `example.com`; denied non-allowlisted host, proxied IP literal,
  direct egress, and direct IP egress), and SSH fail-closed at plan and run,
  then cleaned up with no stale active marker. No code bug surfaced; the only
  friction was the stopped system service, which `doctor` reports. This refreshes
  the V05-G4 runtime evidence on the current host. Static baseline (root and
  Tauri fmt/test/clippy, pin check, UI check/test) was green first. Command
  detail is in `docs/harness/evidence/evidence-log.md`.
- 2026-06-24: Locked the DRY and documentation-first development rule into the
  harness per user directive. Reframed the `AGENTS.md` build-necessity bullet as
  the named DRY ladder (YAGNI, standard library, native platform, installed
  dependency, one line, then minimum custom code) and added
  documentation-is-product and boring-over-clever principles; aligned the
  `change-contract.md` Build Necessity Gate rungs plus acceptance criteria with
  the same wording and the edge-case tiebreaker; added a doc-ships-with-behavior
  and ladder-applied check to the `AGENTS.md` Definition Of Done; recorded the
  standing rule in Product Facts and Key Decisions. Kept one canonical gate
  (no ladder copy/paste) so the change is itself DRY. Docs-only change: verified
  with `git diff --check` (clean) and confirmed the referenced gate path
  resolves; no code, JSON, or pins changed, so cargo/JSON/pin checks were not
  run.
- 2026-06-24: Ran a repo-wide docs accuracy audit across all 54 tracked
  Markdown files against the canonical current state. Root, core-product, and
  most harness docs were already accurate. Fixed: `docs/RESEARCH.md` reframed
  its 2026-06-18 "current image pins" line as dated and added a 2026-06-24
  current-pins note plus a no-workflows qualifier on the Actions source;
  `docs/harness/state/modularization-plan.md` dropped the removed
  `cli/lock.rs` pointer (locking lives in `runtime/lock.rs`) and refreshed the
  largest-file line counts; `.agents/skills/harness/references/repo-harness.md`
  corrected relative paths that were one level too shallow. Verified with a
  repo-wide relative Markdown link check (0 broken), path-resolution checks,
  pin check, JSON validation, and `git diff --check`.
- 2026-06-24: Ran a full dependency pin audit triggered by the `glib`
  Dependabot alert. Confirmed every Cargo, npm, image-CLI, base-image, and
  Debian pin is hard-pinned and that `.github/workflows/` is empty (no actions
  to pin). Brought the 10 pins behind latest stable to current: `time`
  0.3.49->0.3.51; ui `@lucide/svelte` 1.21.0, `svelte` 5.56.4,
  `@playwright/test` 1.61.1, `@tauri-apps/cli` 2.11.3, `svelte-check` 4.7.1,
  `vite` 8.1.0; bundled CLIs Claude Code 2.1.190, Codex 0.142.0, Copilot
  1.0.64, Gemini CLI 0.47.0 (integrity hashes regenerated). Refreshed Cargo and
  npm lockfiles. The `glib` alert was dismissed as not-affected (macOS-only;
  Linux-GTK-only transitive dep capped at 0.18.x). Verified with root and Tauri
  fmt/test/clippy, image dry-run builds, ui ci/check/test/build/e2e,
  `tauri:build`, pin check, JSON validation, and `git diff --check`.
- 2026-06-24: Applied a harness gap-analysis pass against the
  learn-harness-engineering course. Added a `feature_list.json` status_legend
  and marked the single current slice `active`; added a startup baseline gate to
  `AGENTS.md`; added this Key Decisions section; added a boundary-journey table
  and independent-evaluator routing to `security-boundary-map.md`; added
  verify-before-refactor and agent-oriented-error gates to `change-contract.md`;
  defined a representative task set in `quality-document.md` and linked it from
  `roadmap.md`; and added a mechanical `capability_guard` test that fails closed
  if a Tauri capability grants a host bridge. Tauri tests (incl. the capability
  guard), pin check, JSON validation, Markdown link check, and diff checks
  passed.
- 2026-06-18: Clarified the Container Machine policy across active docs and
  harness state. Task-scoped `container run` remains the secure-easy default,
  while explicit or user-managed Apple `container machine` workflows should be
  warned and require intent rather than blocked solely because they are less
  secure.
- 2026-06-18: Ran a full active-doc release-status pass. User-facing docs,
  roadmap/planning docs, Tauri planning docs, and harness routing now agree
  that RunHaven remains alpha/pre-release until after `v0.5.0`, `v0.5.0` is
  CLI-complete, and `v1.0.0` is the first-class desktop release. The README now
  names both goals directly. Historical evidence remains historical.
- 2026-06-18: Added `docs/RELEASE_GAP_ANALYSIS.md` as the active v0.5/v1 gap
  tracker. It records observed CLI command coverage, current desktop command
  coverage, maintainability pressure, v0.5 blockers, v1 blockers, v1.x
  deferrals, and immediate next actions. Linked it from README, roadmap,
  release plan, non-UI backlog, feature state, and harness routing.
- 2026-06-18: Locked secure-easy and maintainability gates into `AGENTS.md`,
  `docs/V1_RELEASE_PLAN.md`, `docs/SECURITY_MODEL.md`, and focused harness
  docs. Future slices must make secure defaults the easiest path, warn and
  require intent for supported lower-security choices, fail closed on hard
  boundary violations, avoid deferred large-file debt, remove meaningful
  duplication, prefer standard/native/installed solutions, keep exact
  current-stable pins, and update harness state when scope changes.
- 2026-06-18: Added and revised `docs/V1_RELEASE_PLAN.md` as the proposed
  durable release ladder. The plan now sets `v0.5.0` as CLI-complete, makes
  `v1.0.0` a first-class desktop release for the safe beginner workflow, keeps
  the CLI as the stable backend and automation surface, records missing
  runtime/data/storage/network/auth/UX/accessibility/performance edge cases,
  and defines release milestones and verification gates. Linked it from
  `README.md` and `docs/ROADMAP.md`; added `cli-complete-v0.5.0` and
  `desktop-first-class-v1` to `feature_list.json`.
- 2026-06-18: Refreshed direct package pins and lockfiles to current stable
  package-manager releases. Tauri Rust pins moved to `tauri` 2.11.3 and
  `tauri-build` 2.6.3; frontend `@tauri-apps/api` moved to 2.11.1; bundled
  image CLIs moved to Claude Code 2.1.181, Codex 0.140.0, and Copilot 1.0.63.
  Cargo and npm lockfiles were refreshed. Playwright now starts an isolated
  strict-port RunHaven dev server instead of reusing an unrelated process on
  port 5173.
- 2026-06-18: Implemented OWASP-informed local hardening from the Cheat Sheet
  review. Tauri commands now reject oversized IPC fields before planning or
  launch confirmation, and RunHaven cache markers, logs, and locks are created
  with owner-only permissions on Unix.
- 2026-06-17: Simplified the repo harness to the lightweight five-subsystem
  model from the referenced harness-learning material. Startup now routes
  through only `AGENTS.md`, `feature_list.json`, and `current-state.md`;
  harness docs are on-demand reference material.
- 2026-06-16: Implemented the first raw-log snapshot slice. `get_log_snapshot`
  lives behind `run-control`, requires sensitive-output acknowledgement,
  validates the run id and RunHaven-owned active container marker, calls only
  bounded `container logs -n`, and keeps raw output out of durable frontend
  state.
- 2026-06-16: Tauri launch flow can confirm launch, check image readiness,
  show resource warnings, render sanitized run snapshots, and refresh live run
  status without exposing raw logs or raw Apple inspect payloads.

## Trusted Verification

## Blockers

- `--ssh` remains fail-closed. Apple `container` 1.0.0 exposes an SSH agent
  socket to the non-root guest user, but `ssh-add -l` returns permission
  denied. Do not re-enable SSH forwarding, mount raw SSH keys, or switch the
  default agent user to root without explicit security review and no-secret
  runtime proof.

## Touched Surfaces In This Pass

- tauri-diagnostics: `src/runhaven/cli/diagnostics.rs` (`auth_status_payload`
  core); `src-tauri/src/commands/diagnostics.rs` (new), `commands/mod.rs`,
  `lib.rs`, `build.rs`, `contracts.rs`, `capabilities/main-read.json`;
  `ui/src/commands/{types.ts,client.ts}`,
  `ui/src/components/DiagnosticsPanel.svelte` (new, self-contained),
  `ui/src/app/App.svelte`, `ui/e2e/app.spec.ts`.
- tauri-kill-repair-run-control: `src/runhaven/runtime/active/mod.rs`
  (`kill_active_run` + thin `runs_kill`), `active/repair.rs` (`repair_active_run`);
  `src-tauri/src/commands/run_control.rs` (kill_run/repair_run + tests),
  `lib.rs`, `build.rs`, `contracts.rs`, `capabilities/run-control.json`;
  `ui/src/commands/{types.ts,client.ts}`, `ui/src/components/RunStatusPanel.svelte`,
  `ui/src/app/App.svelte` (shared `runControl`), `ui/e2e/app.spec.ts`.
- tauri-stop-run-control: `src/runhaven/runtime/active/mod.rs` (`stop_active_run`
  core + thin `runs_stop`); `src-tauri/src/commands/run_control.rs` (new),
  `commands/mod.rs`, `lib.rs`, `build.rs`, `contracts.rs`,
  `capabilities/run-control.json`; `ui/src/commands/{types.ts,client.ts}`,
  `ui/src/components/RunStatusPanel.svelte`, `ui/src/app/App.svelte`,
  `ui/e2e/app.spec.ts`.
- Desktop maintainability split (v1 milestone 1): `src-tauri/src/commands/`
  (`mod.rs`, new `validation.rs`, new `warnings.rs`, sibling import updates);
  `ui/src/commands/` (`runhaven.ts` barrel, new `types.ts`/`client.ts`/`plan.ts`);
  `ui/src/app/App.svelte` plus new `ui/src/components/{SetupChecksPanel,
  PlanReviewPanel,LastLaunchPanel,RunStatusPanel,RunOutputPanel}.svelte`.
- CLI surface verification + git-availability bug fix (code): new
  `scripts/cli_surface_check.sh`; `src/runhaven/support/git.rs`
  (`git_value_available`); `src/runhaven/runtime/worktrees/mod.rs` and
  `merge.rs` (typed `GitSnapshot` matches + regression test);
  `src/runhaven/records/history.rs` and `records/history/diff.rs` (canonical
  reader). Docs: new `docs/CLI_SURFACE_COVERAGE.md`, `docs/harness/evidence/evidence-log.md`,
  `docs/harness/feedback/verification-matrix.md`, `README.md` (docs index),
  `feature_list.json`, and this state file.
- Secure-by-default network (code): `src/runhaven/cli/args.rs` (`--network`
  optional), `src/runhaven/runtime/plans/validation.rs` (`default_network_mode`),
  `mod.rs` (re-export + focused test), `src/runhaven/cli/app.rs` (resolve default
  + provider escape-hatch info line). Docs: `CAPABILITIES`, `USAGE`,
  `ARCHITECTURE`, `SECURITY_MODEL`, `README`, `V1_RELEASE_PLAN`,
  `docs/harness/boundaries/security-boundary-map.md`, `docs/RELEASE_GAP_ANALYSIS.md`,
  `feature_list.json`, and this state file.
- v0.5.0 CLI contract closure (code): `src/runhaven/runtime/plans/types.rs`
  (`security_notices` field), `validation.rs` (`security_notices` function),
  `mod.rs` (compute + carry + focused tests), and `src/runhaven/cli/app.rs`
  (`eprint_security_notices` emitted from `plan` and `run`).
- v0.5.0 CLI contract closure (docs/state): `docs/CAPABILITIES.md` (profile
  support matrix, lower-security overrides, local record files), `docs/USAGE.md`,
  `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/SECURITY_MODEL.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md` (deferred
  TUI phase), `docs/RELEASE_GAP_ANALYSIS.md`, `feature_list.json`, and this
  state file.
- Earlier this session (already committed): macOS 27 runtime evidence
  (`current-state.md`, `docs/harness/evidence/evidence-log.md`).

## Next Step

`cli-complete-v0.5.0`, `runtime-security-hardening`, `multi-provider-broker`, and
`oauth-isolated-login` are all `passing` and on `main` (2026-06-26). No feature
is currently `active`. Per the 2026-06-26 directive, all GUI/UI work stays
deferred to the very end, so the next slice is non-UI product scope toward the
`v0.5.0` CLI-complete milestone.

Candidate next slices (see `docs/NON_UI_BACKLOG.md` v0.5.0 closure):

- CLI command and docs contract audit: confirm every command's help, docs, and
  behavior agree before tagging `v0.5.0`. The docs were just refreshed, so this
  is a focused verification, not a rewrite.
- Profile support tiers: a complete, accurate per-agent support matrix (bundled
  image, basic start, provider mode, interactive login, brokered auth). The
  login work makes this fully answerable now.
- CLI maintainability check on this session's touched surfaces (`login.rs`,
  `endpoints.rs`, `egress.rs`, `observability.rs`, `launch.rs`) for size,
  duplication, and organization debt before more scope lands.
- JSON and local-data lifecycle decision (which CLI outputs are stable,
  schema-versioned, or best-effort).

Separate design-first candidate, not a `v0.5.0` blocker: the signed
auto-updating provider policy (the last piece of the lower-friction egress
design).

The OAuth-brokering research concluded (2026-06-26): no host-side OAuth broker
(provider ToS, subscription token is not a drop-in bearer, would read host login
state). OAuth stays on the isolated in-container login, which is now the active
`oauth-isolated-login` slice (the product's target audience uses OAuth, so easy
OAuth is the priority). Done: once-per-agent auth via `--auth-scope` (verified; Claude OAuth proven
live). THE FOCUSED NEXT EFFORT is the `runhaven login <agent>` command (per-agent
login flows researched and the approach decided 2026-06-26 with the user; full
detail in AgentMemory). It is security-sensitive (host token storage + run-time
injection, broad allowlist widening) and needs live per-agent smokes, so build
carefully:

- Claude (the user's agent): setup-token opt-in. BUILT and live-verified
  2026-06-26 (run came up authenticated, zero friction). `runhaven login claude` runs
  Anthropic's official `claude setup-token` on the host (requires host `claude`),
  captures `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`, stores it `0600` in the RunHaven cache; runs
  then inject it as `--env CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` at run time only (never in the
  printed `plan`), behind the opt-in, with a security notice (the guest then
  holds a usable token; provider-mode egress blocks exfiltration). Add a
  logout/clear path. Claude has no in-container device flow, so this is the
  zero-friction path the user chose.
- Codex + Copilot: clean device-flow login (no PTY). `runhaven login` runs the
  login command in the sandbox (`codex login --device-auth`; `copilot login`),
  captures stdout, auto-opens the device URL on the host, shows the one-time
  code, and lets the CLI poll. Allowlist additions (source-backed, per-host
  verified): codex += `auth.openai.com`; copilot += `github.com` +
  `api.github.com` (note: `github.com` is broad/path-sensitive, a deliberate
  egress widening for the copilot profile, document it). Each needs a live login
  smoke.
- Gemini: account login retired 2026-06-18 and its OAuth is fragile, so the
  API-key broker stays its path (no OAuth login).

The per-run gateway-bind warning is now quieted (commit b8f5b1e). Optional: a
one-time shared-login notice on first shared-volume creation.

Then, the remaining non-UI roadmap:
1. Other design-first candidates from `docs/NON_UI_BACKLOG.md` (custom profile
   schema, path-aware host policy, the in-guest eBPF egress filter for finding #1),
   promoted one at a time through the design gate.
2. Release-readiness for a CLI-based public release once the near-term product
   scope is settled.
Also pending: deciding how the `runtime-security-hardening` branch lands on
`main` (it now holds several distinct slices). The known open blocker is P2 SSH
fail-closed (`ssh-forwarding-boundary`), which needs an upstream non-root socket
fix. A Claude/Gemini broker live smoke needs a real provider API key.

Deferred to the very end (do not start without a new directive): the desktop
maintenance slice (image rebuild, state/network cleanup), the V1-G5 read-only
diagnostics remainder (`why` explanations + blocked-host review + auth explain),
worktree review (V1-G7), and the TUI. Shipped GUI slices stay `passing`.

Tagged release notes are cut at the release-readiness step. Use
`docs/RELEASE_GAP_ANALYSIS.md` for status and `docs/V1_RELEASE_PLAN.md` for the
durable release contract (now superseded on sequencing by this directive).
