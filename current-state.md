# Current State

Last Updated: 2026-06-16 UTC

## Current Objective

RunHaven has been converted from a Python project to a fully functional Rust
CLI while preserving the macOS Apple `container` harness contract, exact pin
policy, and repo-owned verification route.

## State Contract

- `feature_list.json`: machine-readable feature state and durable product
  evidence.
- `docs/harness/evidence/evidence-log.md`: meaningful verification, source
  review, release, or harness evidence.
- `current-state.md`: current objective, trusted verification, touched
  surfaces, blockers, and next step.
- Do not recreate separate root `progress.md` or `session-handoff.md` files.

## Product State

- RunHaven is a Rust 1.96.0 CLI for running AI coding agents inside Apple
  `container` on macOS 26+ on Apple silicon.
- The application code is organized as a Cargo crate under `src/runhaven/` with
  CLI, runtime, provider, image, records, harness, and support modules. Bundled
  image templates live under top-level `images/`.
- The old Python package, Python tests, Python scripts, `pyproject.toml`,
  `.python-version`, and `requirements-dev.txt` have been removed.
- Windows and Linux are not supported runtime or contributor-verification
  targets.
- GitHub Actions CI is disabled during alpha/pre-release to avoid hosted-runner
  cost. Local verification remains authoritative until a maintainer explicitly
  re-enables CI.
- Default product safety boundaries remain: no host home mount, no cloud
  credential folder mount, no raw SSH key mount, no arbitrary environment
  passthrough, explicit workspace scope, non-root bundled images, and
  provider egress allowlisting only through reviewed provider mode.
- HarnessForge output is advisory unless a maintainer promotes a recommendation
  into repo-owned docs, tests, policy, code, or release checks.

## Latest Verified Work

- Rebuilt the CLI in Rust with exact-pinned Cargo dependencies and a checked-in
  `Cargo.lock`.
- Replaced the Python pin checker with `runhaven-check-pins`.
- Updated `init.sh`, root docs, installation docs, usage docs, pinning docs,
  harness docs, component inventory, verification matrix, manifest metadata,
  and former CI routing for the Rust stack.
- Kept file organization nested by responsibility instead of flattening the
  Rust source tree.
- Split large Rust modules so every Rust source file is under 500 lines; the
  current largest file is `src/runhaven/cli/app.rs` at 494 lines.
- Updated `.gitignore` for Rust build output.
- Completed the final active-document accuracy sweep for the Rust conversion
  across product docs, GitHub instructions, harness boundaries, roadmap,
  release controls, and source-mined ideas.
- Removed ignored local cleanup artifacts from the working tree, including
  stale Python cache/build output and `.DS_Store` files.
- Deduped the main README after the overview refresh so the top-level page now
  keeps one compact product/value narrative, one quick-start path, and routes
  detailed feature and command coverage to `docs/CAPABILITIES.md` and
  `docs/USAGE.md`.
- Reworked `docs/CAPABILITIES.md` into a scan-friendly overview with compact
  tables for runtime defaults, profiles, network modes, credentials,
  sessions/state, observability, and current limits.
- Corrected the Cargo development command in installation docs to name the
  `runhaven` binary explicitly.
- Removed the active GitHub Actions workflow and updated pin-policy and harness
  guidance so no hosted CI jobs run during alpha/pre-release.
- Started the Apple Container pre-Tauri coverage review and added
  `docs/APPLE_CONTAINER_GAP_ANALYSIS.md` as the action ledger for remaining
  runtime, security, and verification gaps.
- Added `scripts/apple_container_smoke.sh` as an opt-in local Apple
  `container` smoke harness. The default path covers `doctor`, shell image
  readiness, internal read-only workspace behavior, active-run
  status/logs-follow/stop cleanup, provider planning, and exact cleanup.
  `--with-provider` adds live provider allowlist and egress-denial coverage.
- Fixed the Rust provider CONNECT proxy relay after the live smoke exposed TLS
  tunnel failures. Accepted/tunnel sockets are forced back to blocking mode,
  and CONNECT header reads no longer consume tunneled bytes.
- Added fixture-backed parser tests for Apple `container` JSON shapes covering
  image list, network inspect, container inspect, source-backed legacy
  attachment aliases, invalid shapes, and missing-container repair stderr.
- Tightened parser behavior found during the fixture pass: image matching now
  trusts only actual image-name fields instead of all descriptor annotations,
  and active-run repair no longer removes markers for unrelated `not found`
  inspect failures.
- Extended `runhaven doctor` with JSON-backed Apple `container` runtime pin
  checks. It now fails closed on mismatched runtime commit, builder image,
  vminit image, or Kata kernel fields from the structured
  `container system version --format json` and
  `container system property list --format json` probes.
- Split the new doctor runtime-pin implementation into
  `src/runhaven/cli/doctor/runtime_pins.rs` so the main doctor module stays
  well under the repo's Rust file-size ceiling.
- Extended `runhaven image doctor` with read-only Apple builder diagnostics
  from `container builder status --format json`. The output reports sanitized
  builder state, image, CPU/memory allocation, Rosetta mode, start time, and
  network address while avoiding builder mounts and environment.
- Updated `scripts/apple_container_smoke.sh` to assert that
  `image doctor shell` reports builder status and large-build resource
  guidance.
- Added `docs/TAURI_UI_GUARDRAILS.md` as the pre-implementation contract for
  future Tauri resource warnings, approval gates, typed Rust commands, narrow
  capabilities, and denied-by-default WebView access.
- Added an accepted backlog item to give every maintained script a short
  top-of-file description explaining what it is and what it does.

## Next Step

Close the remaining provider local-network/privacy troubleshooting gap, then
decide whether to do the accepted script-description cleanup or the planned
Rust expert plus Rust skill repo-wide review next. Keep verification local
while alpha CI is disabled.
