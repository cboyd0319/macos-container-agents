# Current State

Last Updated: 2026-06-16 UTC

## Current Objective

Finish the non-UI CLI, safety-policy, documentation, and harness cleanup pass
for the Rust RunHaven CLI while preserving the macOS Apple `container`
boundary, exact pin policy, and repo-owned verification route.

## State Contract

- `feature_list.json`: machine-readable feature state and durable product
  evidence.
- `docs/harness/evidence/evidence-log.md`: meaningful verification, source
  review, packaging, or harness evidence.
- `current-state.md`: current objective, trusted verification, touched
  surfaces, blockers, and next step.
- Do not recreate separate root `progress.md` or `session-handoff.md` files.

## Product State

- RunHaven is a Rust 1.96.0 CLI for running AI coding agents inside Apple
  `container` on macOS 26+ on Apple silicon.
- The application code is organized as a Cargo crate under `src/runhaven/` with
  CLI, runtime, provider, image, records, harness, and support modules. Bundled
  image templates live under top-level `images/`.
- The old Python package, Python tests, Python scripts, `pyproject.toml`,
  `.python-version`, and `requirements-dev.txt` have been removed.
- Windows and Linux are not supported runtime or contributor-verification
  targets.
- GitHub Actions CI is disabled during alpha/pre-release to avoid hosted-runner
  cost. Local verification remains authoritative until a maintainer explicitly
  re-enables CI.
- Default product safety boundaries remain: no host home mount, no cloud
  credential folder mount, no raw SSH key mount, no arbitrary environment
  passthrough, explicit workspace scope, non-root bundled images, and
  provider egress allowlisting only through reviewed provider mode.
- HarnessForge output is advisory unless a maintainer promotes a recommendation
  into repo-owned docs, tests, policy, code, or packaging checks.

## Latest Verified Work

- Added non-mutating CLI explainers for `runhaven why workspace PATH`,
  `runhaven why network MODE`, and `runhaven why state AGENT`; existing
  `why host` remains the provider-host explainer.
- Added focused integration tests and usage docs for the expanded `why`
  commands.
- Added task recipes for read-only review, local-only checks, provider-only
  runs, worktree review, and exact state reset.
- Added `docs/EXTENSION_MCP_BOUNDARY.md` and linked it from the security model
  so future extension or MCP work has a deny-by-default policy before
  implementation.
- Added a `runhaven-check-pins` sensor that enforces top-of-file descriptions
  for maintained shell scripts and bundled image templates.
- Updated the active harness roadmap and source-mined UX notes so completed
  CLI explainers, script-header enforcement, and extension/MCP policy do not
  keep resurfacing as current backlog.
- Rebuilt the CLI in Rust with exact-pinned Cargo dependencies and a checked-in
  `Cargo.lock`.
- Replaced the Python pin checker with `runhaven-check-pins`.
- Updated `init.sh`, root docs, installation docs, usage docs, pinning docs,
  harness docs, component inventory, verification matrix, manifest metadata,
  and former CI routing for the Rust stack.
- Kept file organization nested by responsibility instead of flattening the
  Rust source tree.
- Split large Rust modules so every Rust source file is under 500 lines; the
  current largest file is `src/runhaven/provider/auth_broker.rs` at 499 lines.
- Updated `.gitignore` for Rust build, coverage, profiling, local
  RunHaven/container, macOS, editor, and pre-Rust Python tooling artifacts.
- Completed the final active-document accuracy sweep for the Rust conversion
  across product docs, GitHub instructions, harness boundaries, roadmap,
  packaging controls, and source-mined ideas.
- Removed ignored local cleanup artifacts from the working tree, including
  stale Python cache/build output and `.DS_Store` files.
- Deduped the main README after the overview refresh so the top-level page now
  keeps one compact product/value narrative, one quick-start path, and routes
  detailed feature and command coverage to `docs/CAPABILITIES.md` and
  `docs/USAGE.md`.
- Reworked `docs/CAPABILITIES.md` into a scan-friendly overview with compact
  tables for runtime defaults, profiles, network modes, credentials,
  sessions/state, observability, and current limits.
- Corrected the Cargo development command in installation docs to name the
  `runhaven` binary explicitly.
- Removed the active GitHub Actions workflow and updated pin-policy and harness
  guidance so no hosted CI jobs run during alpha/pre-release.
- Started the Apple Container pre-Tauri coverage review and added
  `docs/APPLE_CONTAINER_GAP_ANALYSIS.md` as the action ledger for remaining
  runtime, security, and verification gaps.
- Added `scripts/apple_container_smoke.sh` as an opt-in local Apple
  `container` smoke harness. The default path covers `doctor`, shell image
  readiness, internal read-only workspace behavior, active-run
  status/logs-follow/stop cleanup, provider planning, and exact cleanup.
  `--with-provider` adds live provider allowlist and egress-denial coverage.
  `--with-ssh` is a no-secret live SSH-forwarding connectivity check with a
  disposable empty `ssh-agent`; it currently exposes an Apple `container` 1.0.0
  non-root socket permission blocker.
- Fixed the Rust provider CONNECT proxy relay after the live smoke exposed TLS
  tunnel failures. Accepted/tunnel sockets are forced back to blocking mode,
  and CONNECT header reads no longer consume tunneled bytes.
- Added fixture-backed parser tests for Apple `container` JSON shapes covering
  image list, network inspect, container inspect, source-backed legacy
  attachment aliases, invalid shapes, and missing-container repair stderr.
- Tightened parser behavior found during the fixture pass: image matching now
  trusts only actual image-name fields instead of all descriptor annotations,
  and active-run repair no longer removes markers for unrelated `not found`
  inspect failures.
- Extended `runhaven doctor` with JSON-backed Apple `container` runtime pin
  checks. It now fails closed on mismatched runtime commit, builder image,
  vminit image, or Kata kernel fields from the structured
  `container system version --format json` and
  `container system property list --format json` probes.
- Split the new doctor runtime-pin implementation into
  `src/runhaven/cli/doctor/runtime_pins.rs` so the main doctor module stays
  well under the repo's Rust file-size ceiling.
- Extended `runhaven image doctor` with read-only Apple builder diagnostics
  from `container builder status --format json`. The output reports sanitized
  builder state, image, CPU/memory allocation, Rosetta mode, start time, and
  network address while avoiding builder mounts and environment.
- Updated `scripts/apple_container_smoke.sh` to assert that
  `image doctor shell` reports builder status and large-build resource
  guidance.
- Added `docs/TAURI_UI_GUARDRAILS.md` as the pre-implementation contract for
  future Tauri resource warnings, approval gates, typed Rust commands, narrow
  capabilities, and denied-by-default WebView access.
- Added an accepted backlog item to give every maintained script a short
  top-of-file description explaining what it is and what it does.
- Added provider-mode troubleshooting guidance that distinguishes allowlist
  denials from host-side proxy reachability or macOS Local Network privacy
  failures.
- Changed `--ssh` to fail closed in planner and run paths while Apple
  `container` 1.0.0 non-root SSH forwarding is blocked. The flag stays visible
  so users get an explicit refusal instead of an implied working private-Git
  path.
- Updated `scripts/apple_container_smoke.sh` so the default path verifies
  `runhaven plan --ssh` refusal, and `--with-ssh` verifies `runhaven run --ssh`
  refusal before launch.
- Added `docs/harness/release/apple-container-update-playbook.md` for Apple
  `container` runtime, helper image, installer, Kata kernel, CLI help, smoke,
  cleanup, and rollback evidence before future pin changes.
- Added top-of-file descriptions to every maintained shell script and bundled
  image template.
- Ran whole-repo Rust expert review and addressed the findings: auth broker
  upstream requests now use the configured global timeout, standard and provider
  launch failures remove active markers and record failed runs when a run
  started, cleanup failures stay visible in run records, the crate is marked
  `publish = false`, and tests were moved out of near-limit files to preserve
  the source-size ceiling.
- Fixed the provider-mode bind regression exposed by live verification. Apple
  `container` 1.0.0 reports a guest gateway that is not bindable on macOS, so
  RunHaven uses the gateway URL for guests while allowing a wildcard host
  listener only with explicit Apple-container subnet rejection.

  commit `ee848e3`, and `container system status` running.
- Alpha CI disablement and Apple Container gap-analysis checks passed:
  `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo test --locked`,
  `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`,
  `cargo run --locked --bin runhaven-check-pins`, `cargo build --locked`,
  JSON validation for `feature_list.json` and `docs/harness/manifest.json`,

  check, Rust source size scan, and `git diff --check`.
- Tauri guardrail and backlog-doc checks passed: official Tauri v2 security,
  capabilities, and permissions docs reviewed; pin policy, JSON validation,
  local Markdown link check, active-doc platform/stale-command scan, and
  `git diff --check` passed.
- Provider local-network/privacy troubleshooting checks passed:
  `scripts/apple_container_smoke.sh --with-provider`, cleanup checks with

## Blockers

- Apple `container` 1.0.0 exposes an SSH agent socket to the RunHaven non-root
  `agent` user with `--ssh`, but the guest cannot use it: `ssh-add -l` returns
  permission denied. RunHaven now fails closed on `--ssh`; do not re-enable it,
  mount raw SSH keys, or switch the default agent user to root without explicit
  security review and no-secret runtime proof.

## Next Step

No additional non-UI implementation task is currently accepted beyond known
candidate research items that need a scoped design or representative evidence.
Keep `--ssh` fail-closed until a no-secret non-root Apple `container` smoke
proves usable forwarding.
