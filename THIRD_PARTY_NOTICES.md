### Modifications

The vendored files were modified by RunHaven on 2026-06-26. The changes are
limited to integration plumbing, not behavior of the copied logic:

- Import paths were adapted to RunHaven's module layout (for example,
  `codex_terminal_detection::` became `super::terminal_detection::`).
- The upstream `tracing` logging call in `terminal_detection.rs` was removed so
  no logging dependency is pulled in.
- TUI and asset-pack couplings that RunHaven does not vendor were removed: the
  `terminal_tests.rs` test-module declaration, the `serial_test` test
  dependency (replaced with a standard-library lock), and the `asset_pack`-based
  test in `model.rs`. A `builtin_spritesheet_path` helper is provided locally to
  keep `model.rs` compiling.
- `animation.rs` is an extract of only the pure frame-selection functions from
  `ambient.rs` (`current_animation_frame`, `frame_at_elapsed`,
  `nanos_to_duration`, and the `AnimationFrameTick` result type). The
  `AmbientPet` struct, `FrameRequester` scheduling, the `PetNotification` state
  machine, and all `crate::tui` / `crate::app_event` / `ratatui` layout
  couplings were excluded. Selected items were widened from `pub(super)` to
  `pub(crate)` so the eventual TUI integration can drive them: `AnimationFrameTick`
  and `current_animation_frame` in `animation.rs`, `Pet::load_with_codex_home`
  and `Pet::frame_cache_key` in `model.rs`, `prepare_png_frames` in `frames.rs`,
  and the frame/spritesheet dimension constants in `catalog.rs`.
