# Research And Source Ledger

Last reviewed: 2026-06-14

This file records sources used for product, security, runtime, and pinning
decisions. Update it whenever a dependency pin, runtime assumption, security
boundary, or agent behavior changes.

## Runtime Sources

- Apple `container` release 1.0.0:
  <https://github.com/apple/container/releases/tag/1.0.0>
- GitHub release API for Apple `container` 1.0.0:
  <https://api.github.com/repos/apple/container/releases/latest>
- Local Apple `container` checkout and bundled docs were consulted. The
  machine-specific checkout path is intentionally omitted from this ledger.

Observed runtime evidence on 2026-06-14:

- `container --version`: `container CLI version 1.0.0`, commit `ee848e3`.
- `container system status`: apiserver running, version 1.0.0, commit
  `ee848e3ebfd7c73b04dd419683be54fb450b8779`.
- Signed installer package:
  `container-1.0.0-installer-signed.pkg`.
- Installer SHA-256:
  `13f45f26da94c354adcbefe1e8f7631e7f126e93c5d4dd6a5a538aa66b4f479d`.
- Installer signing team ID: `UPBK2H6LZM`.
- Recommended Kata kernel URL observed from `container system property list`:
  <https://github.com/kata-containers/kata-containers/releases/download/3.28.0/kata-static-3.28.0-arm64.tar.zst>
- Installed kernel file: `vmlinux-6.18.15-186`.
- Installed kernel SHA-256:
  `2fe4a58d2885d623bcb4d705900ac8c1d4f02371152da8126b3b00c8c47fc3a1`.

Important distinction:

- Runtime pins follow the installed, signed Apple `container` 1.0.0 release and
  live CLI output.
- The local Apple `container` checkout was observed at
  `c8b4fd73a1b1696a1c6533e4de85bdedfa8fc5fc` (`1.0.0-4-gc8b4fd7`) on
  2026-06-14, which is newer than the installed release commit. Do not update
  runtime pins from that local checkout unless the installed runtime is also
  updated and verified.
- The local checkout also references `containerization` `0.33.4`; the installed
  runtime reports `ghcr.io/apple/containerization/vminit:0.33.3`. The installed
  runtime is authoritative for this repo's current pins.

## Apple Container Egress Research

Reviewed on 2026-06-14 for Apple `container` 1.0.0:

- User supplied Apple documentation entrypoint:
  <https://apple.github.io/container/documentation/>
- Rendered Apple DocC pages with Playwright and checked generated DocC JSON:
  <https://apple.github.io/container/data/documentation/containernetworkservice/networkmode.json>,
  <https://apple.github.io/container/data/documentation/containernetworkservice/networkmode/nat.json>,
  and
  <https://apple.github.io/container/data/documentation/containernetworkservice/networkconfiguration.json>.
- Reviewed a complete local DocC snapshot supplied by the user. The snapshot
  was captured from the Apple documentation entrypoint on 2026-06-14 and
  contains 1,022 rendered Markdown pages plus raw DocC JSON with zero fetch
  failures.
- Official Apple `container` 1.0.0 command reference:
  <https://github.com/apple/container/blob/1.0.0/docs/command-reference.md>
- Local installed CLI:
  `container run --help`, `container network --help`, and
  `container network create --help`.
- Local sibling source/docs:
  `../apple-container/docs/command-reference.md`.

Observed command surface:

- `container run` supports DNS selection with `--dns`, DNS-related options,
  `--network`, and `--no-dns`.
- `container network create` supports `--internal` for host-only networks plus
  labels, plugin options, plugin selection, and subnet settings.
- Apple's generated `ContainerNetworkService` docs expose `NetworkMode.nat`,
  where host NAT lets containers reach external services, and
  `NetworkConfiguration` fields for `id`, `mode`, and `subnet`.
- The generated network plugin docs describe an XPC API for IP address
  allocation on a network; they do not describe egress filtering.
- The generated DNS docs expose nameservers, domain, search domain, options,
  and local DNS domain management. These are name-resolution controls, not
  packet or destination controls.
- No domain allowlist or egress allowlist flag was found in the pinned command
  reference, rendered DocC pages, complete generated DocC JSON/Markdown
  snapshot, local CLI help, or local docs search.
- Exact searches across the complete DocC snapshot returned no hits for
  `egress`, `allowlist`, `allow-list`, `allow list`, `denylist`, `blocklist`,
  `firewall`, `packet filter`, `proxy`, or `domain allow`.

Conclusion: RunHaven must not treat DNS selection as egress enforcement. The
reserved `--network provider` mode should fail closed until RunHaven implements
and proves an enforcement mechanism such as a reviewed proxy, DNS filter plus
packet controls, or another Apple `container`-compatible boundary.

## Current Product Conclusions

- Use task-scoped `container run` instead of `container machine` for beginner
  AI-agent workloads. The wrapper must mount only the intended workspace and
  project-scoped agent home volume.
- Do not mount macOS home directories, cloud credential directories, browser
  profiles, or raw SSH keys by default.
- Pass secrets only by explicit environment variable name with `--env NAME`;
  never print secret values in dry-run output.
- Use non-root bundled images, read-only root filesystems, dropped Linux
  capabilities, and per-project named home volumes.
- Use `--read-only-workspace` for review-only tasks.
- Treat internet-enabled runs as unrestricted egress until provider-specific
  allowlisting is implemented.
- Keep `--network provider` fail-closed until code, tests, and live Apple
  `container` smokes prove allowed and denied network paths.
- Keep package, image, runtime, and CI pins current stable and exact. For apt,
  use timestamped Debian snapshots plus exact package versions.
