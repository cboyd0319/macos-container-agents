# Tauri UI Guardrails

Status: pre-implementation contract.

RunHaven does not have a Tauri app scaffold yet. This document defines the
security, resource, and approval boundaries that must exist before a WebView can
control RunHaven operations.

## Source Evidence

- Tauri v2 security docs, reviewed 2026-06-16:
  <https://v2.tauri.app/security/>
- Tauri v2 capabilities docs, reviewed 2026-06-16:
  <https://v2.tauri.app/security/capabilities/>
- Tauri v2 permissions docs, reviewed 2026-06-16:
  <https://v2.tauri.app/security/permissions/>
- Current RunHaven CLI behavior, verified from `src/runhaven/`,
  `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/SECURITY_MODEL.md`, and
  `docs/APPLE_CONTAINER_GAP_ANALYSIS.md`.

## Boundary Rules

- Treat the Tauri WebView as untrusted UI. Keep privileged behavior in typed
  Rust commands.
- Do not expose generic shell, process, filesystem, HTTP, or Apple `container`
  command bridges to JavaScript.
- Define one narrow Tauri command per RunHaven operation. Inputs must be typed
  enums, canonical paths, validated run ids, validated profile names, and
  explicit booleans for destructive confirmations.
- Keep capabilities deny-by-default. A window gets only the permissions it
  needs for its view.
- When the scaffold is added, explicitly list reviewed capability identifiers
  in `tauri.conf.*` and restrict registered commands in the app manifest so
  stray capability files or registered commands do not become broad defaults.
- Do not store provider tokens, SSH material, command lines, prompts, raw
  Apple inspect payloads, environment values, or workspace file contents in
  frontend state or browser storage.
- Keep remote content out of privileged WebViews. If remote content is ever
  needed, it must live in a separate no-privilege window.
- The secure path must be the default and easiest path. Supported advanced or
  risky paths should warn in plain language and require confirmation, but should
  not be hidden or blocked just because they are advanced.

## Initial Capability Shape

Use separate capability files when Tauri is added:

| Capability | Intended window | Allowed operations |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `main-read` | main dashboard | setup status, doctor status, profile list, image doctor summary, active runs, run history summaries |
| `run-control` | run detail view | stop, kill, attach, logs-follow, repair for one validated active run id |
| `launch-run` | explicit run launch flow | plan and run with validated profile, workspace, session, network, resource, and credential options |
| `maintenance` | settings or maintenance view | state reset/prune, network prune, image rebuild, builder guidance after explicit confirmation |
| `release-admin` | disabled until release prep | update, install, uninstall, signing, notarization, updater, registry credential changes |

Do not merge these capabilities into one broad default window permission.

## Resource Guardrails

Apple `container` runs each container inside its own lightweight VM. The UI must
make resource impact visible before starting or rebuilding anything.

Minimum UI state before enabling a run button:

- current active run count from `runhaven runs active --json`;
- selected run CPU and memory limits from the run plan, currently defaulting to
  `--cpus 4 --memory 4g`;
- selected network mode and egress summary from `runhaven plan`;
- selected workspace path and workspace scope;
- selected state volume and session;
- image status from `runhaven image doctor AGENT`;
- builder status and builder CPU/memory guidance from `image doctor`.

Warnings:

- warn when there is at least one active run and the user starts another run;
- warn when the selected memory limit plus active runs could be material on the
  host, even if RunHaven cannot know exact macOS memory pressure yet;
- warn before provider mode, default internet mode, disabled SSH-forwarding
  attempts, explicit env passthrough, sensitive workspaces, root user
  overrides, and worktree discard or merge flows;
- block launch if `runhaven doctor` fails.

Until a dedicated typed UI status command exists, the UI may consume the
existing JSON/text CLI outputs above. Long term, prefer a Rust command that
returns one structured dashboard payload instead of parsing prose.

## Approval Gates

Read-only by default:

- `doctor`;
- `setup`;
- `plan`;
- `agents`;
- `image doctor`;
- `runs active`;
- `runs status`;
- `runs list/show/log`;
- `network list`;
- `state list`;
- `auth status/explain/log`;
- `why host`;
- `egress log`.

Explicit confirmation required:

- `run`;
- `runs attach`;
- `runs stop`;
- `runs kill`;
- `runs repair`;
- `runs merge`;
- `runs discard`;
- `image build`;
- `image rebuild`;
- `state reset`;
- `state prune`;
- `network prune`;
- provider host additions;
- SSH-forwarding attempts while disabled;
- environment passthrough.

Blocked until a dedicated design exists:

- Apple `container system stop`;
- Apple `container` install, update, or uninstall;
- registry login, logout, push, or credential edits;
- machine creation, deletion, or mutation;
- image deletion outside RunHaven-managed rebuild flows;
- volume deletion outside RunHaven-managed state commands;
- updater, signing, notarization, or release publication.

## Command Contract

Future Tauri commands should wrap existing Rust functions directly when
possible. If a sidecar CLI is used during the first UI pass, it must still use
fixed command shapes and validated arguments.

Each Tauri command needs:

- a typed request struct;
- a typed response struct;
- validation that matches or calls the current CLI validators;
- no raw shell strings;
- no unbounded path access;
- no raw Apple `container inspect` passthrough;
- tests for invalid input and confirmation gates.

## Acceptance Before UI Work

- This guardrail document is linked from the roadmap and Apple Container gap
  analysis.
- Tauri/UI research follows
  [`TAURI_UI_RESEARCH_PLAN.md`](TAURI_UI_RESEARCH_PLAN.md) before scaffold work.
- Tauri scaffold work starts with current official Tauri docs and pinned
  versions.
- The first `src-tauri/capabilities/` files and app manifest command list are
  reviewed against this document.
- UI command tests prove denied-by-default behavior before mutating operations
  are wired.
- Local Apple `container` smoke remains the runtime evidence source while
  hosted CI is disabled.
