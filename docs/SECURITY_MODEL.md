# Security Model

## Boundary

Trusted:

- the user
- this Rust CLI
- Apple `container`
- the selected agent image

Untrusted or partially trusted:

- repository contents
- model output
- package install scripts
- MCP servers
- shell commands selected by an agent
- external network responses

Sensitive:

- macOS home directory
- SSH keys and agent socket
- cloud credentials
- model-provider credentials
- browser profiles
- unrelated repositories
- agent session logs

## Default Protections

`runhaven` protects against accidental broad local access by default:

- mounts only the selected workspace
- isolates agent home state in a project/profile/session named volume
- runs a read-only root filesystem
- drops Linux capabilities
- uses a non-root user in bundled images
- does not mount `~/.ssh`, `~/.aws`, `~/.config`, or the macOS home directory
- does not pass host environment variables unless named with `--env`
- rejects broad or credential-bearing workspace paths unless
  `--allow-sensitive-workspace` is passed
- rejects root agent execution unless `--allow-root-user` is passed
- shows the exact command with `runhaven plan`

For bundled non-root images, `runhaven` runs a short volume-preparation preflight
before the agent starts. That preflight mounts only the project-scoped
`/home/agent` volume, sets ownership for UID/GID 1000, runs without DNS, and
uses a dedicated internal network.

`runhaven` also serializes access to each project/profile/session home volume.
This avoids concurrent attachment of the same named volume and keeps the
failure mode understandable for non-technical users. Named sessions selected
with `--session NAME` reuse only the isolated `/home/agent` volume; they do not
widen workspace mounts or host credential access. `state reset` and
session-filtered `state prune` delete RunHaven-managed home volumes only.
`network list` and `network prune --yes` operate only on RunHaven-managed
Apple `container` network names and do not delete arbitrary Apple-managed or
user-created networks.

`image doctor` is read-only. It lists local Apple `container` image metadata,
checks expected bundled RunHaven image tags, compares RunHaven image source
metadata, reviews inactive RunHaven state volume names, and does not build
images, delete resources, mount workspaces, read credentials, or reset state.

## Secure Easy Path And Explicit Overrides

The default and easiest path must be the secure path. New CLI and UI workflows
should make the narrow choice the shortest path: smallest selected workspace,
non-root bundled image, no host credential mounts, no arbitrary environment
passthrough, no raw SSH keys, explicit network choice, and visible plan output.

Supported advanced choices should warn but not hide or block. When a user
intentionally chooses full internet access, a sensitive workspace, root inside
the container, a custom image, environment passthrough, an additional provider
host, worktree merge or discard, state deletion, network pruning, or hard-stop
recovery, RunHaven should show the tradeoff in plain language and require an
explicit confirmation.

Unsupported, invalid, or nonfunctional paths still fail closed. Examples include
failed setup checks, invalid input, missing confirmations, unsupported platform
state, and `--ssh` while the verified Apple `container` non-root forwarding path
does not work. This is not a policy block around a supported choice; it is a
runtime correctness and safety failure.

## Why Not Container Machine

RunHaven uses task-scoped `container run` commands instead of Apple's persistent
`container machine` workflow. The machine workflow is useful for Linux
development environments, but it is the wrong beginner-safe default for AI
coding agents because it can map the host user and home directory into the
guest. Secondary hands-on reporting also notes that the safer machine option is
to disable that home mount.

RunHaven's default boundary is narrower: mount one selected workspace, attach
one project-scoped agent home volume, and never mount the macOS home directory
or raw credential folders by default.

## Auth Broker Boundary

`runhaven auth status` and `runhaven auth explain AGENT` describe the host-side
provider credential broker boundary. The current broker status is a Codex
API-key prototype with all other agent brokers design-only. Those commands read
static profile metadata. They do not inspect Keychain, browser profiles, cloud
credential files, provider login caches, or environment variable values, and
they do not print secrets.

The intended pattern is host-owned credentials with provider-specific policy
tied to the endpoint matrix. The guest should receive only a narrow
provider action or short-lived run credential when that flow is explicitly
implemented and verified. Broad host credential import, implicit environment
passthrough, and host home or credential-folder mounts remain out of scope.

## Extension And MCP Boundary

RunHaven does not currently enable MCP servers, editor extensions, or plugin
marketplaces inside managed agent runs. Future support is deny-by-default and
must follow [`EXTENSION_MCP_BOUNDARY.md`](EXTENSION_MCP_BOUNDARY.md): no host
socket, credential helper, extension, or MCP server is exposed unless the user
explicitly enables it and the plan can show the exact access before launch.

## What This Does Not Solve Yet

The default `internet` network mode should still be treated as unrestricted
egress within the host's network policy. Use `internal` for local-only runs.

`--network provider` is now the constrained egress path for normal agent runs.
It runs the agent on an internal Apple `container` network, starts a host-side
CONNECT proxy, injects proxy environment variables at runtime, and deletes the
managed provider network after the run. Apple `container` 1.0.0 exposes an
internal gateway address to guests that is not always bindable on the macOS
host, so the host listener can bind wildcard while rejecting clients outside the
inspected Apple `container` subnet. The proxy permits the bundled provider hosts
for the selected profile, their subdomains, and explicit fully qualified
`--provider-host HOST` additions. It rejects IP literal proxy targets and
single-label provider hosts. Before opening an upstream connection, the proxy
resolves the destination and rejects non-public resolved addresses such as
loopback, private, link-local, multicast, or otherwise local-only addresses.
It relies on the internal network to block direct guest egress. Blocked proxy
targets are grouped after provider runs with run id, count, denial reason,
matched rule, and suggested next action so users can review missing endpoints
without weakening the default policy.

Provider runs also append allowed and denied CONNECT policy decisions to a
RunHaven cache log. `runhaven egress log` shows recent decisions, including the
matched rule, denial reason, count, profile, workspace, and run id. `runhaven
why host HOST` explains bundled provider-host matches, IP-literal rejection,
and the next review step before the user adds a new host.

Actual agent runs also append one secret-free record to `runs.jsonl`.
`runhaven runs list`, `runhaven runs show RUN_ID`,
`runhaven runs log RUN_ID`, and `runhaven runs diff RUN_ID` expose
completed-run metadata such as run id, profile, workspace, network mode,
return code, provider policy summary, auth broker summary, cleanup outcome, and
matching provider/auth log entries for the run. While a run is active, a
temporary active-run marker records the RunHaven-owned container name so
`runs active` can list current run id, profile, workspace, network mode,
status, and container name. The same marker lets `runs status` call Apple
`container inspect` for curated live state, lets `runs attach` call Apple
`container exec` for a guarded shell or command, lets `runs logs-follow` call
Apple `container logs --follow`, lets `runs stop` call Apple `container stop`,
lets `runs kill` call Apple `container kill`, and lets `runs repair` remove a
stale marker only after Apple `container inspect` reports that the recorded
RunHaven-owned container is not found. `runs repair --all` applies the same
confirmed-missing guard to each valid active marker. Repair JSON output
contains only result status, counts, exit code, run id, container name, and
inspect return code; the marker is removed after the run finishes.
When the workspace is inside a git repository, the run ledger also records repo
root, before and after `HEAD`, dirty state, changed file count, and a capped
list of relative paths scoped to the selected workspace. Run records also store
the workspace scope choice, so later review can distinguish the default
current-directory mount from an explicit `--workspace-scope git-root` run.
For `--worktree` runs, RunHaven requires a clean source repository, creates a
RunHaven-owned branch and git worktree, mounts the worktree instead of the
source checkout, and records the source repo, worktree path, branch, base
commit, and recovery commands. Dirty source checkouts fail before worktree
creation and print safe next choices. `runs recover` and `runs recover --json`
are read-only. Suggested project checks are advisory commands and are not run
automatically. RunHaven does not automatically merge or delete that worktree
after the run.
The run ledger and active-run markers do not record diffs, file contents,
prompts, command lines, agent arguments, attach commands, environment variable
names, environment values, request bodies, or token values. Live container logs
may still contain whatever the agent process printed during the run. `runs diff`
prints a live git diff on demand only after verifying the recorded repo root,
`HEAD`, and path set still match; dirty working-tree diffs include a warning
because metadata cannot prove file contents stayed unchanged after the run.
`runs status` does not print raw Apple `container inspect` data because that
data can include process arguments, environment, and mount details.

Provider host allowlists are intentionally conservative and source-backed.
Bundled auth and provider routing hosts are tracked in
[`PROVIDER_ENDPOINTS.md`](PROVIDER_ENDPOINTS.md). Telemetry, reporting,
release-note, update, plugin marketplace, and broad path-sensitive hosts may
fail until an additional fully qualified host is reviewed and passed with
`--provider-host`.

The host-side auth broker currently has an opt-in Codex API-key prototype. It
keeps the raw API key in the RunHaven host process and gives the guest only a
placeholder token plus temporary Codex custom-provider config. Broker decisions
are logged without request bodies, token values, or environment variable names.
Other providers remain design-only, and credentials can still reach the guest
through isolated in-agent login state or explicit `--env NAME` passthrough. Use
[`AUTH_BROKER.md`](AUTH_BROKER.md) for the current boundary and non-goals.

The selected agent still controls what it reads inside `/workspace` and
`/home/agent`. If the agent has model credentials inside its project volume and
internet access, malicious repository content may still try to exfiltrate those
credentials. Agent-native permission systems remain useful, but they are not a
replacement for the outer container boundary.

## Safe Defaults for Beginners

Use this order:

1. Run `runhaven plan`.
2. Build or select a known image.
3. Run without `--env` first and authenticate inside the isolated agent home
   volume when possible.
4. Use `--env NAME` only when a headless run needs a token.
5. Use `--read-only-workspace` for review and audit tasks.
6. Treat `--ssh` as disabled until Apple `container` non-root forwarding is
   verified; do not mount raw SSH keys as a workaround.
7. Use `--allow-sensitive-workspace` or `--allow-root-user` only when the
   security tradeoff is intentional.
