# Evidence Log

Use this for compact current evidence. Keep raw logs out of this file.

| Date | Scope | Command Or Review | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-06-14 | Harness initialization | `harnessforge init --target .` | passed | Existing `AGENTS.md` was preserved; missing harness files were created. |
| 2026-06-14 | Harness audit | `PYTHONPATH=../HarnessForge/src python3 -m harnessforge audit --target . --min-score 85` | passed | Reported 100/100 after the macOS-only correction. |
| 2026-06-14 | POSIX entrypoint | `PYTHON=<temporary-venv-python> ./init.sh` | passed | Ran compileall, unit tests, pin policy, ruff, mypy, and build. |
| 2026-06-14 | macOS-only support | source and docs review | passed | Removed the non-macOS verification entrypoint and unsupported platform claims. |
| 2026-06-14 | Project logo | `magick identify docs/assets/logo.png` plus visual inspection | passed | Tracked logo asset is a stripped 512x512 PNG used by `README.md`. |
| 2026-06-14 | Harness audit | `PYTHONPATH=../HarnessForge/src python3 -m harnessforge audit --target . --min-score 85` | passed | Current score is 100/100 after removing non-macOS verification surfaces. |
| 2026-06-14 | RunHaven rename | source checks, temporary-venv static checks, build, wheel smoke, no-ignore old-name scan, harness audit | passed | Package, module, command, image tags, docs, tests, and harness state use RunHaven/`runhaven`; ignored local virtualenvs were removed because they encoded stale checkout paths. |
| 2026-06-14 | Runtime hardening and macOS-only boundary | unit tests, static checks, build, `./init.sh`, harness audit, `runhaven doctor`, `runhaven state list`, internal-network smoke, and `runhaven plan` smoke | passed | Command validation, unsafe overrides, TTY controls, state commands, host-only internal network creation, and macOS 26+ only verification are covered. |
| 2026-06-14 | Follow-up hardening pass | focused unit tests, full unit suite, and pin check | passed | Added root group rejection, parser help cwd safety, dynamic image template pin discovery, and run/doctor edge-case coverage. |
| 2026-06-14 | Cleanup pass | stale-reference scan, pin check, JSON validation, diff check, and HarnessForge audit | passed | Removed stale local paths, stale local-venv evidence, and old HarnessForge predecessor references from tracked docs. |
| 2026-06-14 | Second follow-up hardening pass | sandboxed Antigravity audit, `PYTHON=<temporary-venv-python> ./init.sh`, Python 3.13 unit suite, help/plan/doctor smokes, HarnessForge audit, cleanup scans | passed | Added fail-closed network mode validation, leading-zero root identity rejection, sensitive macOS system path blocking, doctor remedies, agent-argument help, and macOS-only pin-ledger enforcement. |
| 2026-06-14 | Provider egress preparation | Playwright-rendered Apple DocC review, complete user-supplied DocC snapshot review, focused fail-closed tests, `PYTHON=<temporary-venv-python> ./init.sh`, Python 3.13 unit suite, doctor smoke, and HarnessForge audit | passed | Added reserved `--network provider` mode that fails closed, explicit plan egress status, and docs stating internet mode remains unrestricted until enforcement is proven. The complete snapshot covered 1,022 rendered Markdown pages plus raw JSON with zero fetch failures and no exact hits for egress or allowlist control terms. |

Rules:

- Record command name, scope, result, and risk.
- Do not paste secrets, local absolute paths, or long command output.
- Prefer one current row per meaningful verification event.
