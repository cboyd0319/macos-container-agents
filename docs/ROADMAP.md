# Roadmap

This roadmap records both completed foundation slices and remaining product
direction. The live feature status and verification evidence are tracked in
`feature_list.json`, `current-state.md`, and
`docs/harness/evidence/evidence-log.md`.

RunHaven remains alpha/pre-release until after the `v0.5.0` CLI-complete
milestone.

Sequencing directive (2026-06-26): all GUI/UI work, the Tauri desktop app and the
terminal UI (TUI), is deferred to the very end of the roadmap. Runtime/security
hardening of the Apple `container` boundary, remaining non-UI product scope, and a
CLI-based public release come first. Already-shipped desktop slices stay complete
and verified; they are re-sequenced, not reverted. This supersedes the prior
`v1.0.0` = first-class-desktop boundary; the version label for the desktop release
is open.

The consolidated non-UI backlog lives in
[`NON_UI_BACKLOG.md`](NON_UI_BACKLOG.md). Tauri/UI research lives in
[`TAURI_UI_RESEARCH_PLAN.md`](TAURI_UI_RESEARCH_PLAN.md).
The proposed durable v0.5.0/v1.0.0 release ladder lives in
[`V1_RELEASE_PLAN.md`](V1_RELEASE_PLAN.md).
The active release gap tracker lives in
[`RELEASE_GAP_ANALYSIS.md`](RELEASE_GAP_ANALYSIS.md).

## Current Release Track

| Target | Goal | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `v0.5.0` | CLI-complete release: command set, docs, JSON/data decisions, runtime smokes, profile support tiers, diagnostics, cleanup, secure-easy defaults, and maintainable module boundaries are complete and verified. | Scope complete (`passing`); tag cut at release-readiness |
| Runtime/security hardening | Re-verify and audit the Apple `container` boundary (runs, provider egress, image, cleanup) on the current host; fix real findings under test before any new surface. | Current objective |
| Remaining non-UI product scope | Promote one design-first candidate at a time from `NON_UI_BACKLOG.md` (custom profiles, MCP allowlists, path-aware host policy, workflow files, and similar), preserving CLI semantics and default safety. | Planned |
| CLI public release | Release-readiness for the hardened CLI product: full local verification, Apple `container` smokes, current pins, docs, and security evidence. | Planned |
| Desktop app (roadmap end) | First-class desktop release: the Tauri app becomes the easiest safe path for setup, image readiness/rebuild, planning, launch, live status, bounded output, stop, kill, repair, diagnostics, worktree review, cleanup, accessibility, signed/notarized artifact, and provenance. Version label open. | Deferred to the very end (2026-06-26 directive) |
| Terminal UI (after desktop) | Terminal UI (TUI) over the same planner and policy objects as the CLI and desktop app. When it ships, the TUI becomes the default interface for interactive terminal use (a bare `runhaven` on a TTY); the CLI stays the complete explicit and automation surface, and non-interactive or explicit-subcommand use bypasses the TUI. Design intent in `docs/plans/ratatui-brand-graphics.md`. | Deferred; after the desktop app |

Design rule for every phase: the secure path must be the easy path. Supported
lower-security choices should warn and require explicit intent; unsupported or
hard-boundary violations still fail closed.

Engineering rule for every phase: avoid large-file debt, remove meaningful
duplication, prefer standard library/native/installed solutions, keep exact
current-stable pins, and keep the harness state current.

## Completed Foundation: Safe Local Baseline

- Rust CLI package and command
- agent profiles
- dry-run planning
- bundled image templates
- doctor checks
- unit tests for command boundaries

## Completed And Ongoing: Network Boundary

- provider network mode integrated into normal `runhaven run`
- live smoke harness for host allowlist proxy on an internal network
- provider-specific egress profiles
- reviewed provider endpoint matrix for auth, provider routing, telemetry,
  package, and optional feature paths
- DNS resolution and unsafe-address rejection inside the provider CONNECT proxy
- provider proxy policy logs for allowed and denied CONNECT decisions
- `runhaven why host ...` diagnostic for provider-host decisions
- grouped blocked-host review with rule, count, run id, and suggested next
  action
- provider-profile smoke support for bundled source-backed hosts
- host-side provider credential broker design with `runhaven auth status` and
  `runhaven auth explain AGENT`
- empty-allowlist regression tests for every network policy mode
- first real host-side provider credential broker implementation
- local proxy option for model credentials
- clear offline and package-install network modes
- live provider auth-flow smokes for optional feature paths
- path-aware provider policy for broad hosts such as `github.com`
- maintainer-curated domain-family egress patterns (`*-name.domain.tld`,
  anchored to one registrable domain, default-deny preserved), used for
  Antigravity so users manage no hosts
- `runhaven login <agent>` isolated per-agent login, live-verified for claude
  (host `claude setup-token`), codex (`codex login --device-auth`), copilot
  (`copilot login`), and antigravity (agy first-run Google OAuth), with
  `--clear`; gemini stays on the API-key broker

## v0.5.0 CLI-Complete Scope

- non-mutating guided first-run setup with exact prerequisite fixes
- plain-language explanations for every requested permission
- `runhaven why` diagnostics for blocked hosts, rejected mounts, sensitive
  defaults, network modes, state volumes, and validation failures
- guided `runhaven setup` first-run flow with profile-specific next commands
- goal-based network selection copy for local-only, provider-only, package
  install, and unrestricted internet use cases
- command docs, help text, JSON/data lifecycle decisions, profile support
  tiers, and release notes aligned with the CLI-complete contract
- no known large-file, duplication, or crate-organization debt intentionally
  deferred from CLI code into v1 desktop work

## v1.x Or Design-First Product Candidates

- signed, auto-updating per-agent provider policy (antivirus-definitions
  model) so new provider endpoints need no release or user action, building on
  the shipped domain-family egress patterns
- custom profile file support
- per-agent policy presets
- MCP allowlists
- import/export of project profiles
- generated docs checks for profiles, network modes, provider hosts, pins, and
  macOS 26+ support text
- agent profile investigation docs for required files, network hosts, update
  paths, auth paths, and known blocked operations
- devcontainer metadata import for image planning, with host lifecycle hooks
  disabled unless explicitly approved
- task-language usage recipes for review-only, local tests, provider-only,
  undo, and state reset workflows
- one-command bootstrap or installer automation for Apple `container`

## Completed And Ongoing: Isolation And Recovery

- run records with `runs list`, `runs show`, `runs log`, `runs diff`,
  `runs keep`, `runs recover`, `runs merge`, `runs discard`, `runs active`,
  `runs status`, `runs attach`, `runs logs-follow`, `runs stop`,
  `runs kill`, `runs repair`, `runs repair --all`, and git change metadata
- structured blocked-host and cleanup event records
- stable JSON output for read-only, run-status, and repair-summary commands
- image doctor, image rebuild, state reset/prune, and managed-network
  list/prune commands
- provider auth broker run records that never print secrets

## Pre-Release Codebase Health Gates

- Rust conversion and modularization completed with source organized under
  `src/runhaven/` by ownership boundary.
- keep source size and cohesion checks active so command surfaces, policy logic,
  run-state handling, and verification helpers remain reviewable.
- review touched Rust, Tauri, and frontend files for duplication and
  modularity before calling a slice complete.
- run the `rust-expert` agent with the Rust skill across the entire repo to
  look for correctness, safety, idiomatic Rust, test, packaging, and
  maintainability issues before broadening the product surface.
- use the `apple-container-expert` agent with the Apple Container skill for
  Apple `container` runtime, networking, source, service, registry, machine,
  and security-boundary work.
- add a short top-of-file description to every maintained script so future
  contributors can see what each script is and what it does before running it.

## Runtime Readiness Gates

- Action the coverage gaps in
  [`docs/APPLE_CONTAINER_GAP_ANALYSIS.md`](APPLE_CONTAINER_GAP_ANALYSIS.md)
  before broadening runtime-sensitive CLI or desktop behavior.
- Keep the consolidated non-UI backlog in
  [`NON_UI_BACKLOG.md`](NON_UI_BACKLOG.md) current before promoting any
  candidate item to implementation.
- Keep opt-in live Apple `container` smoke coverage for command shapes and JSON
  parsing that unit tests cannot prove.
- Keep `runhaven doctor` enforcing the reviewed Apple `container` runtime
  commit, builder image, vminit image, and Kata kernel pins.
- Keep `image doctor` surfacing read-only builder status and resource guidance
  before adding UI flows that trigger rebuilds.
- Keep [`docs/TAURI_UI_GUARDRAILS.md`](TAURI_UI_GUARDRAILS.md) as the active
  contract for UI resource warnings, approval gates, typed Rust commands, and
  narrow Tauri capabilities.

## Desktop Surface: Shipped Slices, Re-Sequenced To Roadmap End

These slices are complete and verified. Per the 2026-06-26 directive they are
re-sequenced behind runtime/security hardening, remaining non-UI product scope,
and a CLI public release; the desktop release version label is open.

- Completed 2026-06-16 in
  [`docs/TAURI_UI_RESEARCH_PLAN.md`](TAURI_UI_RESEARCH_PLAN.md).
- Decision: Tauri v2 with Svelte + Vite + TypeScript, npm lockfile, a separate
  `src-tauri` crate that calls the existing Rust library, narrow capabilities,
  and a secure default path with warning-confirmed advanced choices.
- First scaffold work is validated with exact-pinned Tauri/Svelte
  dependencies, a separate `src-tauri` crate, narrow capabilities, setup,
  dashboard, profile, folder-pick, and run-plan surfaces.
- First mutating slice is implemented: `launch_run` reuses the Rust launch
  path, requires explicit launch and warning confirmation, blocks when setup
  checks fail, and lives behind the `launch-run` capability.
- Launch readiness now shows typed image and builder status and blocks launch
  when the selected bundled profile image is missing or stale.
- Launch planning now warns when other RunHaven runs are active and when the
  selected memory limit plus active runs may be material on the host. The
  post-launch UI shows a sanitized run snapshot.
- The dashboard can read a typed live run-status snapshot for the latest
  launched run, showing marker status, container state, resources, image, and
  network metadata without raw logs or raw Apple inspect payloads.
- Raw log viewing now follows
  [`TAURI_LOG_VIEWING_DESIGN.md`](TAURI_LOG_VIEWING_DESIGN.md): status first,
  then an explicitly requested bounded container-stdio snapshot, with no
  automatic display, no durable frontend storage, and no live stream.
- After the `v0.5.0` CLI-complete scope is closed or explicitly accepted, add
  first-class desktop controls for stop, kill, repair, image build/rebuild,
  diagnostics, worktree review, and safe cleanup.
- Before the desktop release, the desktop app must be keyboard navigable,
  accessible at the minimum supported window size, signed, notarized,
  checksummed, and backed by release provenance.
- Remaining UI controls should still be added one at a time with typed Rust
  commands, explicit confirmation, focused tests, and narrow capabilities.

## Later Repeatable Workflows

- strict project-local workflow files
- container-only setup, main, and teardown steps
- workflow state, resume, and failure policy
- read-only context overlays for docs, skills, prompts, and project memory
- deny-by-default extension and MCP boundary policy documented in
  [`EXTENSION_MCP_BOUNDARY.md`](EXTENSION_MCP_BOUNDARY.md)
- source-of-truth planner and policy objects reusable by future CLI, API, or
  GUI surfaces
