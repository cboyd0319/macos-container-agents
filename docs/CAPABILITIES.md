# Capabilities

RunHaven runs AI coding agents inside Apple `container` with local-Mac safety
defaults. This page is the product overview: what RunHaven can do, what it
protects by default, and where the current limits are.

RunHaven only supports macOS 26+ on Apple silicon. Windows and Linux are not
supported runtimes or contributor verification targets.

RunHaven remains alpha/pre-release until after `v0.5.0`. The CLI is the
current working product surface. `v0.5.0` should finish and verify the CLI
contract; `v1.0.0` should make the Tauri desktop app the first-class safe path
for less-technical users.

For command walkthroughs, use [Usage](USAGE.md). For the full security boundary,
use [Security model](SECURITY_MODEL.md).

## At A Glance

| Area | What RunHaven provides |
| --- | --- |
| Runtime boundary | One selected workspace, one isolated agent home volume, non-root bundled images, read-only root filesystem, dropped Linux capabilities, and explicit command preview. |
| Agent profiles | Bundled Claude, Codex, Gemini, Antigravity, Copilot, and shell profiles, plus custom images through the `shell` profile. |
| Network modes | Secure profile-aware default (provider allowlist where the agent's hosts are bundled, otherwise internet), plus local-only internal networking and explicit override. |
| Workspace safety | Current-directory mounts by default, explicit git-root expansion, sensitive-path rejection, and optional RunHaven-owned git worktrees. |
| Credentials | No host home, raw SSH key, browser profile, cloud credential folder, or arbitrary environment passthrough by default. |
| Observability | Secret-free run records, active-run controls, provider policy logs, auth broker status, and recovery commands. |
| Cleanup | Focused image, state-volume, network, and worktree recovery for resources RunHaven owns. |

## Runtime Defaults

RunHaven generates Apple `container` commands with these defaults:

| Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Workspace mount | One selected project directory is mounted at `/workspace`. |
| Agent home | One per-project/profile/session volume is mounted at the agent home path. |
| Host secrets | macOS home, raw SSH keys, browser profiles, cloud credential folders, and arbitrary host environment variables are not mounted or passed. |
| Container user | Bundled images run as the non-root `agent` user. |
| Filesystem | The container root filesystem is read-only, with temporary scratch space. |
| Linux privileges | Linux capabilities are dropped. |
| Preview | `runhaven plan` prints the selected workspace, state volume, network mode, egress status, preflight, and Apple `container run` command before execution. |

The default workspace scope is the current directory. If that directory is
inside a larger git repository, RunHaven does not silently mount the repository
root. Use `--workspace-scope git-root` only when the agent needs the full
repository at `/workspace`.

## Agent Profiles

| Profile | Default image | Use case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `claude` | `runhaven/claude:0.1.0` | Claude Code with isolated project state |
| `codex` | `runhaven/codex:0.1.0` | Codex CLI with its own workspace sandbox enabled |
| `gemini` | `runhaven/gemini:0.1.0` | Gemini CLI with project-scoped home state |
| `antigravity` | `runhaven/antigravity:0.1.0` | Antigravity CLI in the same container boundary |
| `copilot` | `runhaven/copilot:0.1.0` | GitHub Copilot CLI with isolated state |
| `shell` | `runhaven/base:0.1.0` | Generic shell profile for custom agent images |

Use `shell` with `--image IMAGE` when you want to run another agent image.

## Profile Support Matrix

Every bundled profile builds an image and starts through `runhaven run PROFILE`.
They differ in provider-network backing and authentication support tiers.

| Profile | Provider hosts | Interactive auth | Headless broker | Key limit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `claude` | Bundled: `api.anthropic.com`, `claude.ai`, `platform.claude.com` | Claude.ai or subscription login in isolated state | API-key broker: `--api-key-broker-env`, `x-api-key` via `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` | API key brokered host-side; OAuth and subscription logins use isolated state |
| `codex` | Bundled: `api.openai.com`, `chatgpt.com` | ChatGPT or OpenAI sign-in in isolated state | API-key broker: `--api-key-broker-env`, Responses API (`/v1/responses`) | Key brokered host-side; ChatGPT sign-in uses isolated state |
| `gemini` | Partial: only `generativelanguage.googleapis.com` bundled; `accounts.google.com` and Vertex hosts are candidates | Google account login or API key in isolated state | API-key broker: `--api-key-broker-env`, `x-goog-api-key` via base-URL redirect | Redirect env is undocumented upstream and version-fragile; Vertex and account login are not brokered |
| `copilot` | Bundled: seven `githubcopilot.com` hosts | GitHub OAuth device flow in isolated state | Design-only (cannot be brokered cleanly) | Token exchange + dynamically-routed API host; use isolated state |
| `antigravity` | Bundled: Google OAuth, userinfo, and Cloud Code hosts plus the `*-cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com` model-endpoint family | First-run Google login in isolated state (`runhaven login antigravity`) | None | No API-key broker; uses isolated login state. Google sign-in consent and redirect happen in the host browser |
| `shell` | None | Decided by the custom image | None | Generic base for custom images; you supply image and credentials |

"Design-only" means no credential broker is wired yet, so headless use relies on
isolated login state or an explicit `--env NAME`. See
[Provider endpoints](PROVIDER_ENDPOINTS.md) and [Auth broker](AUTH_BROKER.md)
for the source-backed detail.

## Network Modes

| Mode | Use it for | Egress behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `internet` | Hosted-agent runs that need package managers, registries, CDNs, or arbitrary hosts. | Unrestricted outbound access. Provider-domain allowlisting is not enforced. |
| `internal` | Local-only analysis, offline tests, and custom images that do not need internet. | Host-only Apple `container` network. |
| `provider` | Agent runs limited to the agent's own reviewed provider hosts. | Managed internal network plus RunHaven's host-side allowlist CONNECT proxy. |

When you do not pass `--network`, RunHaven picks the secure default that still
works: `provider` for profiles with bundled provider hosts (`claude`, `codex`,
`copilot`, `gemini`, `antigravity`) and `internet` for profiles without them
(`shell`), where provider mode would have an empty allowlist. Pass
`--network` to override. A provider-default run reaches the agent's own API but
not arbitrary hosts; add `--provider-host HOST` or use `--network internet` when
the run needs more.

Provider mode allows bundled provider hosts for the selected profile, their
subdomains, and reviewed fully qualified `--provider-host HOST` additions. The
proxy rejects IP literal targets and destinations that resolve to local-only
addresses such as loopback, private, link-local, or multicast ranges.

Provider mode is intentionally stricter than internet mode. Some login,
telemetry, package-registry, update, or provider feature-path hosts may need
review before being added. Use the
[provider endpoint matrix](PROVIDER_ENDPOINTS.md) for that review.

## Lower-Security Overrides

Secure defaults are the easiest path. Every supported choice that lowers
security below those defaults is an explicit flag, and both `runhaven plan` and
`runhaven run` print plain-language `Security notices` to standard error for
each active one. Hard-boundary violations still fail closed.

| Override | What it lowers | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--network internet` | Unrestricted outbound egress with no domain allowlist. The default only for profiles without bundled provider hosts (`shell`). | profile-aware |
| `--env NAME` | Exposes one host environment variable to the agent; a secret there can be read by workspace code. `NAME=value` is rejected. | none |
| `--user USER` / `--allow-root-user` | Runs the agent as a different or root container user instead of the non-root `agent` user. Root or UID 0 fails closed without `--allow-root-user`. | `agent` |
| `--provider-host HOST` | Widens the provider allowlist with one reviewed fully qualified host. | bundled hosts only |
| `--allow-sensitive-workspace` | Permits mounting broad or credential-bearing host paths at `/workspace`. Sensitive paths fail closed without it. | rejected |
| `--image IMAGE` | Runs a custom image that may not follow the bundled non-root, read-only-root hardening. | bundled profile image |
| `--ssh` | Would forward the SSH agent socket. Currently fails closed; see the [security model](SECURITY_MODEL.md). | disabled |

The notices clear when you run with secure defaults. `runhaven why network MODE`,
`why workspace PATH`, and `why host HOST` explain each decision in more detail.

## Workspace And Git Safety

Use the smallest project directory the agent needs. RunHaven rejects broad or
credential-bearing workspace paths unless `--allow-sensitive-workspace` is
passed.

For clean git repositories, `runhaven run AGENT --worktree` creates a
RunHaven-owned branch and git worktree under the RunHaven cache directory, then
mounts that worktree at `/workspace`. The source checkout stays untouched until
you explicitly merge worktree changes back.

Worktree support includes:

| Command family | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `runs keep` | Validate the recorded worktree and print review guidance. |
| `runs recover` | Show read-only recovery state and suggested project checks. |
| `runs merge` | Validate the recorded source/worktree boundary before bringing changes back. |
| `runs discard` | Remove the recorded RunHaven-owned worktree and branch without touching the source checkout. |

See [Usage](USAGE.md) for the full worktree workflow.

## Credential Handling

RunHaven does not mount raw SSH keys, browser profiles, cloud credential
folders, provider login caches, or arbitrary host environment variables by
default.

| Credential mechanism | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `--api-key-broker-env NAME` | Enables the host-side API-key broker for provider-network Codex, Claude, or Gemini runs, keeping the raw key on the host (old name `--codex-api-key-broker-env` still works as an alias). |
| `runhaven login <agent>` | Signs in once and later runs reuse it: Claude via a host `claude setup-token` (the token is injected at run time), and Codex, Copilot, and Antigravity via an in-sandbox login on the shared home volume. `--clear` removes the login. See [Auth broker](AUTH_BROKER.md). |
| `--auth-scope agent\|project` | `agent` (default) shares one login per agent across all your projects so an OAuth login is done once; `project` isolates the login to this workspace's own volume. |
| `runhaven auth status` / `runhaven auth explain AGENT` | Explains current broker boundaries without reading or printing secrets. |

Pass a single reviewed host variable with `--env NAME`, or forward SSH with
`--ssh` (currently fails closed). Both are lower-security choices that print a
security notice; see [Lower-security overrides](#lower-security-overrides).

## Sessions And State

Each project/profile gets an isolated default agent home volume. Use
`--session NAME` to create a named reusable project/profile home volume without
changing the workspace mount or widening host credential access.

Session and state commands manage RunHaven-owned agent home volumes only. They
do not touch workspace files.

## Observability And Recovery

RunHaven records secret-free run metadata under its cache directory. Records
include run id, profile, workspace, workspace scope, network mode, return code,
provider policy summary, auth broker summary, cleanup outcome, and git metadata
when available.

| Need | Commands |
| --- | --- |
| Review completed runs | `runs list`, `runs show`, `runs log`, `runs diff` |
| Inspect or control active runs | `runs active`, `runs status`, `runs attach`, `runs logs-follow`, `runs stop`, `runs kill`, `runs repair` |
| Review safety and policy decisions | `why host`, `why workspace`, `why network`, `why state`, `egress log` |
| Inspect auth broker state | `auth status`, `auth explain`, `auth log` |
| Repair bundled images and inspect builder state | `image doctor`, `image rebuild`, `image build --dry-run` |
| Manage isolated state volumes | `state list`, `state reset`, `state prune` |
| Manage RunHaven networks | `network list`, `network prune --yes` |

Run records do not store diffs, file contents, prompts, command lines, agent
arguments, attach commands, environment variable names, environment values,
request bodies, or token values. Live container logs may still contain whatever
the agent process printed during the run.

### Local Record Files

RunHaven keeps three append-only JSON Lines files under its cache directory
(`RUNHAVEN_CACHE_HOME`, otherwise `~/Library/Caches/runhaven/`), created with
owner-only permissions:

| File | Holds |
| --- | --- |
| `runs.jsonl` | One record per completed run: ids, profile, workspace path, network mode, return code, and provider/auth summaries. |
| `egress-policy.jsonl` | Provider proxy allow/deny decisions with target host and port. |
| `auth-broker.jsonl` | Codex broker allow/deny decisions with method and upstream path. |

These on-disk record shapes are best-effort and pre-stable: they carry no schema
version and may change before `v1.0.0`, so do not parse them as a stable
contract yet. The `--json` output of `runs`, `egress log`, and `auth log` is the
supported read path. The files are append-only with no rotation or size cap, so
they grow over time; delete a file to reset that history. They store metadata
only (paths, hostnames, decisions) and never secrets, tokens, request bodies, or
command arguments.

## Current Limits

RunHaven is not a complete data-loss or exfiltration solution.

- Internet mode does not restrict outbound domains.
- Provider mode uses conservative host allowlists; some provider features may
  need additional reviewed fully qualified hosts.
- The selected agent can still read files inside `/workspace` and its isolated
  agent home volume.
- Credentials inside the agent home volume or passed with `--env NAME` may be
  misused by malicious repository content.
- Host-side API-key brokering covers Codex, Claude, and Gemini. Copilot and
  Antigravity are not brokered and use isolated in-container login state.
- Agent-native approval systems are useful, but they are not a replacement for
  the outer container boundary.

See [Security model](SECURITY_MODEL.md) and [Security policy](../SECURITY.md)
for the full boundary.
