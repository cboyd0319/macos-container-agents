# AGENTS.md

## Project

RunHaven is a Rust CLI, with an alpha Tauri/Svelte desktop shell, for running
AI coding agents inside Apple `container` on macOS 26+ on Apple silicon.

The product safety boundary matters more than convenience. Do not mount host
home directories, cloud credential folders, raw SSH keys, browser profiles, or
arbitrary host environment variables by default. Do not relax container
isolation, non-root runtime, mount exclusions, read-only root filesystem,
capability drops, or explicit environment passthrough without a user-approved
security tradeoff and focused verification.

Above all else, the secure path must be the easy path. Secure defaults should
be the shortest, clearest workflow. Supported less-secure choices should warn
and require explicit intent, but should not be hidden or blocked only because
they are less secure. Unsupported, invalid, or hard-boundary violations still
fail closed.

Apple `container machine` is not the default RunHaven boundary, but explicit or
user-managed machine workflows are not blocked solely for being less secure. If
RunHaven adds machine integration, it must warn about host-home and credential
exposure, require explicit intent, and preserve focused verification.

## Startup

1. Confirm the working directory and inspect git state:

```bash
pwd
git status --short --branch
```

2. Read these startup files only:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `feature_list.json`
- `current-state.md`

`current-state.md` is this repo's progress and handoff file. Do not recreate
separate root `progress.md` or `session-handoff.md` files.

3. Before stacking new work on a surface that may already be broken, run its
   smallest check from `docs/harness/feedback/verification-matrix.md`. Fix a
   broken baseline before adding new changes.

4. Load more context only when the task needs it:

- Product, install, usage, or public docs: `README.md` and relevant `docs/`.
- Security boundary changes: `docs/SECURITY_MODEL.md` and focused tests.
- CLI, image, provider, Tauri, or frontend changes: inspect that component's
  manifests, tests, and local modules first.
- Harness maintenance: `.agents/skills/harness/SKILL.md` and
  `docs/harness/README.md`.

## Harness Contract

Keep the harness small and useful:

- Instructions: this file is a map, not a manual.
- Tools: shell, file edits, git, and `init.sh` are enough for normal work.
- Environment: versions and pins live in manifests, lockfiles, and `pins.toml`.
- State: `feature_list.json` plus `current-state.md` record status and next
  steps.
- Feedback: use explicit checks before claiming completion.

If a harness file is not needed for the current task, do not read it at startup.
If a harness rule keeps causing context cost without preventing failures,
delete or compress it.

## Verification

Use the smallest reliable check set for the change.

Focused checks:

```bash
cargo fmt --check
cargo test --workspace --locked
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings
cargo run --locked --bin runhaven-check-pins
cargo build --workspace --locked
npm --prefix ui run check
npm --prefix ui test
npm --prefix ui run test:e2e
npm --prefix ui run build
git diff --check
```

Full local verification on macOS 26+:

```bash
./init.sh
```

Use `runhaven doctor` and Apple `container` smokes only when changes affect the
actual runtime boundary, image templates, provider behavior, install flow, or
Tauri launch/run-control behavior.

## Working Rules

- All current and future development is DRY. Walk the build-necessity ladder
  and stop at the first rung that satisfies the request: (1) does it need to
  exist at all (YAGNI); (2) does the standard library do it; (3) does a native
  platform feature cover it (`<input type="date">` over a picker library, CSS
  over JS, a schema or DB constraint over app code); (4) does an
  already-installed dependency solve it, and never add a new one for what a few
  lines can do; (5) can it be one clear line. Then write the minimum custom
  code that works. `docs/harness/boundaries/change-contract.md` holds the full
  gate, including the security and correctness carve-outs.
- Documentation is product: if a behavior is not documented it does not exist.
  Ship the doc change in the same slice as the behavior.
- User-facing writing is part of the product boundary. Write UI text, menus,
  prompts, warnings, README/usage docs, and setup instructions for
  non-technical users at roughly an 8th grade reading level. Prefer short
  sentences, plain verbs, concrete nouns, and clear next actions. Keep exact
  commands, paths, hosts, and security facts when they matter; explain them in
  plain language instead of hiding them.
- TUI source-first rule: for `crates/runhaven-tui/src/tui/`, vendor or adapt
  from the official local Codex TUI source at
  `/Users/c/Documents/GitHub/codex/codex-rs/tui` before writing custom code.
  Custom TUI code is allowed only for RunHaven domain data, security-boundary
  mapping, RunHaven asset swaps such as `docs/assets/logo.png`, or small glue
  where no Codex equivalent exists. Document each exception in the TUI plan or
  architecture docs.
- Boring over clever: choose the obvious construct, because clever is what
  someone has to decode at 3am. Between two standard-library options of similar
  size, take the one correct on edge cases; lazy means writing less code, not
  picking the flimsier algorithm.
- Eliminate meaningful duplication everywhere. Prefer deletion or one small
  shared helper over copy/paste, but do not add speculative abstractions.
- Think before coding: define success criteria, surface uncertainty, and name
  meaningful tradeoffs before implementation.
- Design workflows so the secure path is the default and easiest path; make
  supported less-secure paths explicit and warned.
- Match local style and helper APIs.
- Keep files, modules, crates, Tauri commands, and frontend components cohesive.
  If a touched file is already difficult to review or would become so, split it
  along existing boundaries in the same slice instead of creating large-file
  debt.
- Keep the Rust workspace organized by ownership boundary. `crates/runhaven`
  owns binary entrypoints only. `crates/runhaven-core` owns runtime, provider,
  records, image, doctor, diagnostics, support, harness, and shared UI
  contracts. `crates/runhaven-cli` owns Clap dispatch and human CLI
  presentation. `crates/runhaven-tui` owns the Codex-vendored terminal UI and
  RunHaven TUI adapters. `src-tauri` is a workspace member that depends on
  `runhaven-core` through typed commands. Do not recreate a root compatibility
  facade or put shared runtime truth in the CLI/TUI crates.
- Use exact subprocess argument lists, not executable shell strings, for
  runtime command generation.
- Keep direct dependencies, package manifests, runtime pins, and image package
  pins exact-pinned, minimal, and current stable. Lock transitive dependencies.
  Verify volatile version claims against current official sources before
  changing pins.
- Preserve user changes. Never revert dirty work unless explicitly requested.
- Use `rg` for repository searches and keep noisy output bounded.
- Use `apply_patch` for manual edits.
- Keep project-specific facts in repo docs, not chat history.
- Keep the repo harness updated when active state, release scope, verification
  routing, or operating rules change.
- If code, files, docs, config, dependencies, or harness surface do not need to
  exist, delete them.
- Do not add Windows or Linux runtime or contributor-verification targets.

## Specialist Routing

- For Rust work in this repo, use
  `/Users/c/Documents/GitHub/persona/content/skills/rust`.
- For non-trivial Rust implementation, review, debugging, or test-gate work,
  use the `rust-expert` and `rust-test-debug-architect` agents with bounded
  ownership, then verify their findings against live files.
- For security-sensitive changes, use `security-engineering`; use
  `adversarial-review` for major architecture or boundary claims before
  committing.
- Antigravity (`agy`) is research-only in this repo. Do not use it for
  end-of-slice code review, adversarial review, verification, or proof of
  correctness.
- For direct Codex CLI behavior or vendored Codex TUI behavior, use
  `codex-cli-guide` and the local Codex source/config as evidence.
- For RunHaven TUI work, use the `rust`, the Persona Codex TUI skill at
  `/Users/c/Documents/GitHub/persona/content/skills/codex-tui`, and
  `adversarial-review` together as the end-of-slice gate before commit: Rust
  crate/tooling correctness, Codex source-pattern alignment, then boundary and
  overclaim review. The repo-local `.agents/skills/codex-tui` wrapper exists
  only to make that Persona skill discoverable from this project.
- For Codex-vendored TUI and `codex-*` dependencies, preserving the original
  Codex package name, crate name, and module path is the default. Use a local
  bridge only when compiling or activating the real Codex surface would cross a
  RunHaven security boundary that has not been designed and tested.

## Definition Of Done

- Target behavior or documentation change is complete.
- Any changed behavior ships its documentation in the same slice; an
  undocumented behavior is treated as not done.
- The DRY build-necessity ladder was applied: no higher rung (no change,
  deletion, documentation, standard library, native platform, installed
  dependency, one line) already covered the work.
- Relevant checks ran, or skipped checks are named with reason and risk.
- Security, data-loss, accessibility, and platform-parity requirements were not
  weakened.
- File size, modularity, duplication, dependency use, and crate/component
  organization were considered for touched surfaces.
- `feature_list.json` and `current-state.md` reflect any changed active state.
- The next session can restart from the three startup files above.
