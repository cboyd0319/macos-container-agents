# Progress

Last Updated: 2026-06-15

## Current Objective

Implement `runhaven runs status RUN_ID` for active RunHaven run visibility.

## Current State

- The project has been renamed to RunHaven.
- The Python package, import module, console command, image tags, resource
  prefixes, cache path, tests, docs, and harness metadata now use `runhaven`.
- The old project, module, CLI, env var, runtime path, and filename patterns are
  absent from all working tree files outside `.git`.
- Ignored local `.venv*` directories were removed because generated activation
  scripts and editable-install metadata encoded the old local checkout path.
- The GitHub repository remote has not been renamed because that is a
  credentialed vendor change requiring explicit approval.
- Harness state files now exist: `feature_list.json`, `progress.md`, and
  `session-handoff.md`.
- Verification entrypoint now exists: `init.sh`.
- Harness docs now exist under `docs/harness/`.
- `AGENTS.md` now includes Startup, Verification, Definition Of Done, state
  file routing, and End of Session instructions.
- `docs/HARNESS_EVALUATION.md` records the before and after audit result.
- `docs/assets/logo.png` is now the tracked project logo and is displayed by
  `README.md`.
- RunHaven is now documented and checked as macOS 26+ only. Windows and Linux
  runtime or contributor-verification targets are intentionally unsupported.
- The non-macOS verification entrypoint was removed.
- Command construction now rejects unsafe image references, invalid resource
  values, broad or credential-bearing workspaces, comma-containing workspace
  paths, and root agent execution unless explicitly overridden.
- Internal network reuse now verifies Apple `container` reports `hostOnly`.
- `runhaven state list` and `runhaven state prune --yes` manage isolated agent
  home volumes.
- Dev dependencies now match the `unittest` suite and no longer include pytest.
- `scripts/check_pins.py` now enforces `pins.toml` against source files.
- Follow-up hardening now rejects root group identities such as `agent:0`
  unless `--allow-root-user` is explicit.
- CLI help no longer resolves the current working directory during parser
  construction.
- `scripts/check_pins.py` now discovers image template `Containerfile` and
  npm-backed package directories dynamically.
- Added tests for `runhaven run`, doctor command error paths, root group
  rejection, and help behavior with an unavailable current directory.
- Second follow-up hardening now rejects invalid programmatic network modes
  instead of silently using internet mode.
- Root user detection now treats leading-zero numeric identities such as `00`
  and `agent:00` as root.
- Sensitive macOS system paths such as `/System`, `/Library`, and `/etc` now
  require `--allow-sensitive-workspace`.
- `runhaven doctor` now prints concise remediation for failed checks.
- `runhaven plan` and `runhaven run` help now explain the `--` separator for
  agent flags.
- Pin policy now records the RunHaven package/image version in `pins.toml`,
  checks package and image version consistency from that ledger, and rejects
  non-macOS GitHub runner pins.
- Apple DocC documentation was rendered with Playwright and cross-checked
  through generated DocC JSON endpoints because the raw HTML page is a
  JavaScript shell.
- The complete user-supplied DocC snapshot was reviewed: 1,022 rendered
  Markdown pages plus raw DocC JSON, zero fetch failures, and no exact hits for
  egress or allowlist control terms.
- Apple `container` 1.0.0 exposes NAT networking, DNS selection, subnet
  settings, and host-only networks, but no reviewed domain egress allowlist
  surface was found in rendered docs, generated JSON, local CLI help, or the
  pinned command reference.
- `runhaven plan` now prints explicit egress status for the selected network,
  provider hosts, and the runtime proxy injection note for provider mode.
- A standard-library CONNECT allowlist proxy now exists in `src/runhaven/egress.py`.
- `scripts/provider_egress_smoke.py` proves the proxy pattern with a temporary
  internal Apple `container` network.
- Live smokes passed for the default public host and for `api.openai.com`:
  allowed proxied HTTPS succeeded, while denied proxied host, proxied IP
  literal, direct DNS, and direct IP paths failed.
- `runhaven run --network provider` now creates a managed internal network,
  inspects its gateway and subnet, starts the host-side allowlist proxy, injects
  proxy environment variables, runs the agent, and deletes the managed provider
  network in cleanup.
- Bundled provider host allowlists now exist for Claude, Codex, Gemini, and
  Copilot. `--provider-host HOST` adds reviewed fully qualified extra hosts for
  provider mode.
- Provider host additions reject IP literals and single-label hosts, so entries
  like `com` cannot accidentally allow broad suffixes. A listed host permits
  that host and its subdomains.
- Provider mode now records blocked CONNECT host/port pairs in memory, caps the
  list, and prints a stderr summary after the run with review guidance for
  fully qualified host additions.
- Provider mode now resolves allowed hosts before connecting and denies
  loopback, private, link-local, multicast, and otherwise non-public resolved
  addresses.
- Provider mode now records allowed and denied proxy policy decisions and
  persists them to a JSONL cache log after each run.
- `runhaven egress log` now shows recent provider proxy decisions, with JSON
  output available for automation.
- `runhaven why host ...` now explains provider-host matching, IP literal
  rejection, bundled profile matches, and the next review step before a user
  adds a new host.
- `src/runhaven/provider_endpoints.py` is now the structured provider endpoint
  ledger for bundled, candidate, optional, and build-time hosts.
- `docs/PROVIDER_ENDPOINTS.md` records the source-backed provider endpoint
  matrix and explains why broad path-sensitive, telemetry, update, reporting,
  and weakly sourced hosts stay explicit.
- Source-backed bundled provider defaults now include Claude auth hosts,
  Codex ChatGPT auth, and Copilot-specific routing hosts. Antigravity still has
  no bundled runtime hosts because no minimal source-backed endpoint set has
  been identified.
- `runhaven why host ...` now surfaces known explicit-review endpoints, such as
  Copilot `api.github.com`, with the reason they are not bundled.
- Provider runs now print grouped blocked-host reviews with run id, count,
  denial reason, matched rule, and suggested next action.
- `runhaven egress log` now includes the run id in text output, matching the
  JSONL log field.
- `scripts/provider_egress_smoke.py --agent AGENT` now checks all bundled
  provider hosts for a selected profile through the same host-side proxy
  pattern, without requiring provider credentials.
- A live normal-run smoke passed for `runhaven run shell --network provider
  --provider-host example.com`: allowed proxied HTTPS succeeded, while denied
  proxied host, proxied IP literal, direct DNS, and direct IP paths failed.
- `container machine` remains out of scope for the default product boundary
  because Apple's docs say it maps the host username and home directory into the
  Linux environment.
- Supplemental Apple `container` sources supplied by the user were reviewed and
  recorded in `docs/RESEARCH.md`: Apple Open Source, DeepWiki, Wikipedia, The
  Register, HowToUseLinux, Apidog, and Suraj Deshmukh.
- The new source review reinforced current RunHaven decisions: macOS 26+ only,
  task-scoped `container run`, no `container machine` default, no host home
  mount, and no DNS-as-egress-control claim.
- Sibling repos `awman`, `aspec`, and `maki` were manually mined for
  transferable ideas. AGY/Antigravity was intentionally not used for this pass.
- The complete source-mined recommendation set is recorded in
  `docs/harness/source-mined-ideas.md` and summarized in
  `docs/harness/research-inbox.md`.
- High-value promoted candidates include provider endpoint matrix, provider
  proxy DNS/private-address guard, worktree isolation, workspace scope
  selection, run observability, typed run options, strict workflow files,
  context overlays, generated docs drift checks, JSON/headless output, and
  deny-by-default MCP or extension boundaries.
- The pass does not discard ideas merely because they are large. It stages them
  by dependency and risk while preserving the hard product boundary: macOS 26+
  only, Apple `container` only, no Docker fallback, no Windows/Linux runtime
  support, no host home or credential mounts by default, and no
  `container machine` default.
- Current external open source projects were manually researched for adjacent
  ideas. The full result is recorded in
  `docs/harness/external-project-ideas.md`.
- External source-backed candidates now in the backlog include `runhaven why`
  diagnostics, provider proxy policy logs, empty-allowlist regression tests,
  host-side provider credential brokering, agent profile investigation docs,
  devcontainer metadata import for image planning, warm reusable project
  sessions, and explicit extension/MCP boundary policy.
- A UX-focused research pass is recorded in
  `docs/harness/ux-research-ideas.md`.
- UX candidates now in the backlog include guided `runhaven setup`, goal-based
  network selection, `runhaven why`, provider policy logs, grouped
  blocked-host review, `runs list/show/log/diff/attach/stop`, worktree review
  flows, image/state/network repair commands, `auth status`, and
  task-language docs recipes.
- `src/runhaven/auth_broker.py` now records per-profile auth broker metadata
  and implements the first Codex API-key broker prototype.
- `runhaven run codex --network provider --codex-api-key-broker-env NAME` reads
  the named host environment variable only during real runs, starts a
  subnet-restricted host broker on the Apple `container` provider network, and
  injects temporary Codex custom-provider config plus a placeholder token into
  the guest.
- The Codex broker accepts only Responses API create requests and injects the
  raw host API key into the host-side upstream request to `api.openai.com`; the
  raw key is not placed in the planned command or guest environment.
- `runhaven plan` and `runhaven run --dry-run` show broker status but do not
  read the named API-key environment variable.
- Missing Codex broker environment variables fail before Apple `container`
  runtime startup.
- `runhaven auth status` and `runhaven auth explain AGENT` now describe the
  current host-side broker boundary without reading Keychain, browser profiles,
  cloud credential files, provider login caches, or environment values.
- `runhaven auth status --json` and `runhaven auth explain AGENT --json` expose
  broker metadata for automation without secret values.
- `docs/AUTH_BROKER.md` records the Codex prototype status, remaining
  design-only provider status, trust boundary, provider auth notes, non-goals,
  and remaining acceptance criteria.
- `docs/RESEARCH.md` now records the current provider auth references and the
  official Codex configuration references used for this broker boundary.
- The Codex broker now records in-memory decisions with method, sanitized path,
  allow/deny outcome, reason, upstream status, and count.
- Brokered Codex runs now write secret-free entries to
  `auth-broker.jsonl` under the RunHaven cache root. The log omits token
  values, request bodies, and environment variable names.
- `runhaven auth log` and `runhaven auth log --json` now display recent auth
  broker decisions without inspecting credential stores or environment values.
- `scripts/codex_broker_smoke.py` can run a real non-interactive Codex request
  through the broker when `RUNHAVEN_CODEX_BROKER_SMOKE_API_KEY` or another
  named disposable-key env var is set. Without the key it prints `SKIP` and
  exits successfully unless `--require-api-key` is passed.
- Actual `runhaven run` executions now append secret-free records to
  `runs.jsonl` under the RunHaven cache root.
- `runhaven runs list` and `runhaven runs show RUN_ID` now display run id,
  profile, workspace, network mode, return code, provider policy summary, auth
  broker summary, and cleanup outcome.
- `runhaven runs log RUN_ID` and `runhaven runs log RUN_ID --json` now join the
  selected run record with matching provider policy and auth broker entries for
  the same run id.
- Git workspaces now add a run metadata summary with repo root, before and
  after `HEAD`, dirty state, changed file count, and a capped list of relative
  paths scoped to the selected workspace. Non-git workspaces are recorded as
  git unavailable.
- `runhaven runs show RUN_ID` and `runhaven runs log RUN_ID` now print a
  compact git summary line when metadata is present.
- `runhaven runs diff RUN_ID` now validates recorded git metadata against the
  live workspace and prints a live git diff for committed changes or dirty
  workspace changes.
- `runhaven runs diff RUN_ID` refuses when git metadata is unavailable, the
  recorded repo or workspace is gone, `HEAD` no longer matches the recorded
  run, the recorded path list was truncated, or the current dirty path set
  differs from the run record.
- Dirty working-tree diffs print a warning because RunHaven can verify the
  recorded `HEAD` and path set, but not exact file contents since the run.
- Planned and actual agent runs now include a RunHaven-owned Apple `container`
  name derived from profile and workspace.
- Active runs now write a temporary secret-free marker under
  `active-runs/<run-id>.json` in the RunHaven cache root. The marker records run
  id, profile, workspace, network mode, state volume, host pid, and container
  name, but not command lines, agent arguments, environment variable names,
  environment values, request bodies, prompts, or token values.
- `runhaven runs stop RUN_ID` now reads the active marker, verifies the
  container name is RunHaven-owned, marks stop requested, and calls Apple
  `container stop` for that container.
- `runhaven runs active` now lists current active-run markers in text or JSON
  without requiring Apple `container` access. It skips invalid or
  non-actionable marker files.
- `runhaven runs attach RUN_ID` now reads the active marker, verifies the
  container name is RunHaven-owned, rejects root attach without
  `--allow-root-user`, and calls Apple `container exec` to start a guarded
  shell or command in the active container.
- `runhaven runs logs-follow RUN_ID` now reads the active marker, verifies the
  container name is RunHaven-owned, and calls Apple `container logs --follow`
  with a configurable recent-line cap.
- `runhaven runs status RUN_ID` now reads the active marker, verifies the
  container name is RunHaven-owned, calls Apple `container inspect`, and prints
  only curated marker, state, image, resource, and network fields.
- Active markers are removed after run completion. If a run exits after a stop
  request, the completed run record is marked `stopped`.
- Run records omit diffs, file contents, prompts, command lines, agent
  arguments, environment variable names, environment values, request bodies,
  and token values.
- Empty provider allowlist behavior is now covered at both the planner and
  proxy-policy layers.
- `internet` mode is regression-tested as no provider allowlist and
  unrestricted internet egress.
- `internal` mode is regression-tested as no provider allowlist and internet
  egress disabled.
- `provider` mode is regression-tested as fail-closed when the selected
  profile and explicit `--provider-host` values produce an empty allowlist.
- Profiles without bundled provider hosts, such as `shell` and `antigravity`,
  are regression-tested so they require an explicit fully qualified
  `--provider-host` before provider mode can plan.
- `EgressPolicy` is regression-tested so an empty allowlist cannot become an
  allow-all policy.

## Recommended Next Step

Add a guarded `runhaven runs kill RUN_ID` hard-stop command for explicit
recovery when graceful `runs stop` fails or hangs. Run the optional Codex
broker smoke with a disposable OpenAI API key when one is available.

## Verification Evidence

- 2026-06-15: `container --help`, `container exec --help`, and
  `container attach --help` were checked. The pinned local Apple `container`
  CLI exposes `exec`; `attach` reports plugin `container-attach` is not
  installed.
- 2026-06-15: Local `container logs --help` shows
  `container logs [--boot] [--follow] [-n <n>] <container-id>`.
- 2026-06-15: Local `container inspect --help` shows
  `container inspect [--debug] <container-ids> ...`; local
  `container inspect buildkit` confirmed JSON output with raw process
  arguments, environment, and mounts.
