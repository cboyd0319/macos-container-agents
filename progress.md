# Progress

Last Updated: 2026-06-14

## Current Objective

Reserve provider egress mode without claiming allowlisting is enforced, and
record verified Apple `container` networking evidence.

## Current State

- The project has been renamed to RunHaven.
- The Python package, import module, console command, image tags, resource
  prefixes, cache path, tests, docs, and harness metadata now use `runhaven`.
- The old project, module, CLI, env var, runtime path, and filename patterns are
  absent from all working tree files outside `.git`.
- Ignored local `.venv*` directories were removed because generated activation
  scripts and editable-install metadata encoded the old local checkout path.
- The GitHub repository remote has not been renamed because that is a
  credentialed vendor change requiring explicit approval.
- Harness state files now exist: `feature_list.json`, `progress.md`, and
  `session-handoff.md`.
- Verification entrypoint now exists: `init.sh`.
- Harness docs now exist under `docs/harness/`.
- `AGENTS.md` now includes Startup, Verification, Definition Of Done, state
  file routing, and End of Session instructions.
- `docs/HARNESS_EVALUATION.md` records the before and after audit result.
- `docs/assets/logo.png` is now the tracked project logo and is displayed by
  `README.md`.
- RunHaven is now documented and checked as macOS 26+ only. Windows and Linux
  runtime or contributor-verification targets are intentionally unsupported.
- The non-macOS verification entrypoint was removed.
- Command construction now rejects unsafe image references, invalid resource
  values, broad or credential-bearing workspaces, comma-containing workspace
  paths, and root agent execution unless explicitly overridden.
- Internal network reuse now verifies Apple `container` reports `hostOnly`.
- `runhaven state list` and `runhaven state prune --yes` manage isolated agent
  home volumes.
- Dev dependencies now match the `unittest` suite and no longer include pytest.
- `scripts/check_pins.py` now enforces `pins.toml` against source files.
- Follow-up hardening now rejects root group identities such as `agent:0`
  unless `--allow-root-user` is explicit.
- CLI help no longer resolves the current working directory during parser
  construction.
- `scripts/check_pins.py` now discovers image template `Containerfile` and
  npm-backed package directories dynamically.
- Added tests for `runhaven run`, doctor command error paths, root group
  rejection, and help behavior with an unavailable current directory.
- Second follow-up hardening now rejects invalid programmatic network modes
  instead of silently using internet mode.
- Root user detection now treats leading-zero numeric identities such as `00`
  and `agent:00` as root.
- Sensitive macOS system paths such as `/System`, `/Library`, and `/etc` now
  require `--allow-sensitive-workspace`.
- `runhaven doctor` now prints concise remediation for failed checks.
- `runhaven plan` and `runhaven run` help now explain the `--` separator for
  agent flags.
- Pin policy now records the RunHaven package/image version in `pins.toml`,
  checks package and image version consistency from that ledger, and rejects
  non-macOS GitHub runner pins.
- Apple DocC documentation was rendered with Playwright and cross-checked
  through generated DocC JSON endpoints because the raw HTML page is a
  JavaScript shell.
- The complete user-supplied DocC snapshot was reviewed: 1,022 rendered
  Markdown pages plus raw DocC JSON, zero fetch failures, and no exact hits for
  egress or allowlist control terms.
- Apple `container` 1.0.0 exposes NAT networking, DNS selection, subnet
  settings, and host-only networks, but no reviewed domain egress allowlist
  surface was found in rendered docs, generated JSON, local CLI help, or the
  pinned command reference.
- `runhaven plan` now prints explicit egress status for the selected network.
- `--network provider` is reserved and fails closed until RunHaven has a
  verified provider egress enforcement mechanism.

## Recommended Next Step

Design the actual provider egress enforcement mechanism and prove allowed and
denied paths with live Apple `container` runtime smokes. Keep the current
macOS 26+ only runtime and verification boundary intact.
